TITLE: THE BREAK ROOM
FADE IN:
INT. MODERN BUILDING – BREAK ROOM 1 – SATURDAY MORNING 1
A sterile, fluorescent-lit corporate break room. Beige walls. An
unused kitchen to the side. Coffee machine on a plastic table
gurgles. A clock ticks louder than it should.
Sunlight beams through high glass walls. A white board reads:
“INFINITE DYNAMICS – SATURDAY PROFESSIONAL GROWTH WORKSHOP –
8:00 AM”
Eight office chairs in a semicircle. Coffee pot brewing.
Fluorescent lights flicker overhead.
CHAD/ANDRE (32), clipboard in hand, adjusts chairs with clinical
precision. He wears business-casual like armor.
One by one, they arrive.
ELENA/MIA (29), pristine blazer, perfect posture, eyes the chair
and sits across the room.
PEDRO/JAY (27), confident stride, dress shirt open at the
collar, offers ELENA/MIA a nod and fist bumps LUIS/BLAZE.
KARINA/KATHERINE (24), sketchbook in hand, quietly slides into
the corner chair, unnoticed. Watches them from behind her book.
JACOB/RANDAL (26), glasses fogged from the outside air, clutches
his laptop like a life raft. Heads to the coffee stand and pours
a cup before he sits down.
ALEX/BENNY (19), wide-eyed intern with a clipboard, slips in,
tries not to make noise.
VALENTIN/ERIC (24), impeccably styled, chilled. Surveys the
room before sitting down.
LUIS/BLAZE (30), disheveled, hoodie up, slumps into a chair
and kicks it back like he owns the place.
CHAD/ANDRE (32), HR manager in khakis, moves forward.
Clapping once.
CHAD/ANDRE
Good morning, team! I am Andre DuMond.
I’ll be facilitating today’s fun.
CHAD/ANDRE (CONT’D)
2.
Thank you for volunteering for this
mandatory group workshop.
LUIS/BLAZE
Oxymorons before coffee. Love it.
He shares a smile with PEDRO/JAY.
CHAD/ANDRE
I’m here to guide, but mostly to
listen. You’ll each complete a
“Personal Mission Statement.”
It's not punishment. It's alignment.
ELENA/MIA
And this is... how long?
CHAD/ANDRE
One full workday. Think of it as a
reboot.
PEDRO/JAY
Great. So we’re broken.
CHAD/ANDRE
(sharp) I didn’t say that. But your
manager might have.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (26), quietly entering, sets up tech gear in
the back.
KRASTYO/NATHAN
(to CHAD/ANDRE) Sorry, I thought it
was in the other room.
CHAD/ANDRE ignores him and looks at them all. Curt. Poised.
CHAD/ANDRE
Is that clear? Mission statement.
End of the day. (Beat) I’ll be back
to check on you.
Silence. They’ve all chosen seats in a wide semicircle.
JACOB/RANDAL
So... do we just start writing?
ELENA/MIA
Some of us prepare. Some just stare.
KARINA/KATHERINE
(without looking up) We are all
staring.
3.
Tension in the air. PEDRO/JAY breaks it.
PEDRO/JAY
Team building at its finest.
He smirks. Luis/Blaze smirks back.
JACOB/RANDAL drinks the coffee. It doesn’t taste great.
Silence. ALEX/BENNY chooses his moment to speak.
ALEX/BENNY
Should we, like... go around and say
our names?
LUIS/BLAZE
What is this, kindergarten?
ALEX/BENNY
I just thought it’d be—
LUIS/BLAZE
—You thought wrong.
ELENA/MIA
Let him speak.
LUIS/BLAZE
Says the exec with the corner office.
ELENA/MIA
Says the rebel who’s been written up
four times.
PEDRO/JAY
Alright, simmer down kids.
PEDRO/JAY smirks again.
KARINA/KATHERINE (DRY)
This is going great.
Another long beat. Eventually VALENTIN/ERIC can’t take it
anymore and gets up, heads to the white board.
Writes: “WELCOME TO THE CULTURE CURE.”
They all watch him. He looks back at them.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Just branding our collective
breakdown.
ALEX/BENNY thinks before speaking.
4.
ALEX/BENNY
Can we get matching T-shirts?
They laugh. It’s the first mutual laugh.
A tension of unspoken agreements lingers in the air.
LUIS/BLAZE
Alright. Let’s air the laundry, shall
we?
ELENA/MIA
Only if it’s dry-clean only. I have
standards.
Luis/Blaze and ELENA/MIA make eye contact. She looks away
first.
PEDRO/JAY
Mine’s soaked in Red Bull and regret.
Luis/Blaze and ALEX/BENNY smirk.
JACOB/RANDAL blurts out.
JACOB/RANDAL
I wrote an apology email once. Never
hit send.
KARINA/KATHERINE
I wrote one and sent it to the wrong
manager.
ALEX/BENNY
I sent a meme to the CFO. Thought it
was my roommate.
VALENTIN/ERIC
What was the meme?
ALEX/BENNY
A pigeon in a suit yelling ‘optics!’
They all laugh. It cracks something open.
INT. BREAK ROOM – HALLWAY 2 ADJACENT – LATER 2
PEDRO/JAY moves towards the water machine, watching ELENA/MIA as
she pours a cup.
PEDRO/JAY
What’s your real reason for being
here?
5.
ELENA/MIA
I asked too many questions during a Q2
review. Got flagged as disruptive.
PEDRO/JAY
Same. I call that leadership.
He watches her as she moves away.
INT. BREAK ROOM 3 – COFFEE STATION 3
JACOB/RANDAL refills a cup obsessively. LUIS/BLAZE eyes him.
LUIS/BLAZE
How many cups you on?
JACOB/RANDAL
Just trying to survive.
LUIS/BLAZE
You okay?
JACOB/RANDAL
Define “okay.”
LUIS/BLAZE
Thought so.
JACOB/RANDAL drinks the coffee, still tastes like shit.
Luis/Blaze watches him then looks over to the disused
kitchen.
LUIS/BLAZE edges to the kitchen, motions to PEDRO/JAY.
LUIS/BLAZE (CONT’D)
(To JACOB/RANDAL) Bet you five bucks I
can open up one of those locked
cupboards in the kitchen.
JACOB/RANDAL
What’s in it for me?
LUIS/BLAZE
Coffee with dignity.
JACOB/RANDAL
You're on.
PEDRO/JAY joins Luis/Blaze and they head into the kitchen area.
KARINA/KATHERINE notices and silently trails behind. As does
Krastyo/Nathan.
6.
INT. KITCHEN 4 – CONTINUOUS 4
An dusty, out of service kitchen, used for making sandwiches.
Luis/Blaze tries to open the cupboards but with no luck.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Risky move.
LUIS/BLAZE (SMIRKING)
Thought you were mute.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Only around loudmouths.
PEDRO/JAY finds a stash of imported coffee pods.
PEDRO/JAY
Jackpot.
KRASTYO/NATHAN watches from the behind them, expression
unreadable.
5 INT. BREAK ROOM – LATER 5
They return smug. Everyone now drinking upgraded coffee.
CHAD/ANDRE peeks in, suspicious.
CHAD/ANDRE
It smells like you’ve discovered more
to life in that instant coffee?
ALEX/BENNY
We found it in the cupboard?
He moves to ALEX/BENNY. Annoyed.
CHAD/ANDRE
Let me put this in words you
understand. (Beat) The Kitchen is
off limits. If i catch anyone...
He pauses. Clearly ruffled. A moment between him and Krastyo.
CHAD/ANDRE exits.
LUIS/BLAZE
We just triggered the scent alarms.
ELENA/MIA
Sent alarm is a thing?
7.
LUIS/BLAZE
No. Of course not.
Another beat between them.
VALENTIN/ERIC steps up, again.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Come on, for fucks sake. Let’s get
going on this so we can maybe go
home sooner?
It’s an outburst. There is something going on.
LUIS/BLAZE
(Taking the piss) I recon you live
on the ‘ocean man’.
VALENTIN/ERIC takes it personally.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Fuck you man!
Valentin/Eric moves to Luis/Blaze.
VALENTIN/ERIC (CONT’D)
You little bitch. What you got to
say now.
Luis/Blaze looks a little apologetic but doesn’t say
anything.
VALENTIN/ERIC (CONT’D)
Thought so.
VALENTIN/ERIC moves away more annoyed with himself?
VALENTIN/ERIC (CONT’D)
Can we at least write something to
get this going.
A few nods.
PEDRO/JAY
What else you got, hot shot?
INT. 6 BREAK ROOM – LATER 6
New words have been written on the board. Bad empowering
statements mainly. Nothing great. But at least it is something.
The group lounges more loosely now. Tension has settled. They’re
no longer strangers but not yet allies.
8.
ALEX/BENNY
Does anyone else feel like we’ve been
trapped here for weeks?
KARINA/KATHERINE
Time dilates in beige rooms.
PEDRO/JAY
I once did a 10-hour budget meeting in
a room like this. Came out speaking
only in bullet points.
ELENA/MIA
Sounds like upper management fluency.
LUIS/BLAZE
I once locked myself in a supply
closet just to avoid a quarterly checkin.
VALENTIN/ERIC
That sounds... productive.
JACOB/RANDAL
I envy your ability to rebel. I just
keep nodding until my neck hurts.
LUIS/BLAZE
Start small. Skip a spreadsheet. Leave
a cell blank. Watch the chaos.
They chuckle.
ELENA/MIA and maybe other takes annoyance to this.
ELENA
(Sarcastic) Watch the chaos! The
chaos that guys like him create.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Exactly!
LUIS/BLAZE
Calm down Mia. That’s corporate
life. Work hard get replaced. Smile
anyway.
ELENA/MIA
No! We all work hard and we will
watch you get replaced.
Krysto/Nathan makes a noise.
Blaze notices, stands up.
9.
LUIS/BLAZE
What you been doing. You’ve been
very quiet.
Nathan closes his note book
LUIS/BLAZE (CONT’D)
Let me see
Nathan moves the book away. Blaze tries to go for it, on the
second time. Eric jumps and twists and pulls him away from
Nathan.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Back off man.
They square off.
Pedro/Jay rushes in.
PEDRO/JAY
Hey. Hey! Chill out guys.
Hey moves Eric back.
PEDRO/JAY (CONT’D)
Chill out man.
Eric nods, calms.
ALEX/BENNY
(to Blaze) Respect his privacy.
Blaze looks to Benny but moves back to his chair.
Pedro/Jay moves to the centre.
PEDRO/JAY
Fuck the shit! I’m the one who
might lose his job here. (Beat) You
guys don’t know shit what’s going
in this company!
They all watch him. Jay realises he might have said too much.
Heads back to his chair.
PEDRO/JAY (CONT’D)
Can we just get this thing done so
we can leave.
They watch and some nod.
10.
INT. BREAK ROOM – COFFEE REFILL 7 STATION – LATER 7
KARINA/KATHERINE draws something in her sketchbook. ALEX/BENNY
peeks over.
ALEX/BENNY
That’s... us?
KARINA/KATHERINE
Stylized. But yeah.
ALEX/BENNY
You gave me heroic eyebrows.
KARINA/KATHERINE
You earned them when you stood up to
LUIS/BLAZE.
ALEX/BENNY (GRINNING)
That was more like a terrified squeak.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Sometimes that’s the bravest kind.
A sweet moment between them.
8 INT. BREAK ROOM – LATER 8
Chairs are pushed closer. Postures are slouched but open.
ELENA/MIA
I had this perfect five-year plan. It
cracked in year two.
PEDRO/JAY
I was the five-year plan. My dad made
it. I just followed the line.
JACOB/RANDAL
I keep redrafting mine. Every failure
gets a new column.
LUIS/BLAZE
Never made one. Can’t fail what you
don’t define.
VALENTIN/ERIC
I made one, laminated it, and lost it
on day one.
KARINA/KATHERINE
I think mine was just “survive.”
11.
A long, quiet beat.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (FROM THE BACK)
That’s a plan too.
They all look to Krastyo. A deep moment between them.
CHAD/ANDRE suddenly bowls in. Closes the doors with a bang.
Steps to the front of the room.
CHAD/ANDRE
A new challenge: devise a solution for
a company in crisis. The scenario is
fictitious.
ELENA/MIA
Let me guess — budget cuts, brand
collapse, and one executive scandal?
CHAD/ANDRE
Now you're catching on.
PEDRO/JAY
I want to be the whistleblower.
JACOB/RANDAL
Can I be the panic-prone analyst?
KARINA/KATHERINE
Too late. That’s me.
VALENTIN/ERIC
I’ll be the PR spin doctor. Obviously.
LUIS/BLAZE
Put me in charge. I’ll drive it into
the ground faster.
ALEX/BENNY
I’ll just take notes and try not to
cry.
CHAD/ANDRE
You have one hour. The board — that’s
me — expects a full report.
CHAD/ANDRE drops a folder full of background info and leaves.
Beat.
ELENA/MIA
We could sabotage this just to spite
him.
12.
PEDRO/JAY
Or we ace it. Make him question
everything.
JACOB/RANDAL
I’m strangely into that.
They lean in. The game begins.
INT. BREAK ROOM – TWENTY 9 MINUTES LATER 9
The whiteboard is covered in chaotic diagrams. Sticky notes
everywhere. PEDRO/JAY speaks passionately — too passionately —
about 'synergizing stakeholder trust.'
PEDRO/JAY
And if we reposition the blame
downstream, we can redirect scrutiny
and —
A loud, high-pitched WHINE. A strange buzzing.
JACOB/RANDAL
Is that... is that coming from the
projector?
ALEX/BENNY
Is it broken?
Suddenly, a glitchy corporate jingle BLASTS from the ceiling
speakers. Lights strobe for a moment. Everyone flinches.
ELENA/MIA
What fresh HR hell is this?
Krastyo/nathan rushes out.
Luis/Blaze starts dancing. Its hilarious. ALEX/BENNY joins
is, as do the others. It’s catchy.
CHAD/ANDRE rushes in with KRASTYO / NATHAN.
CHAD/ANDRE
That’s... not supposed to happen.
KRASTYO / NATHAN
Sorry — the AV system runs on 2007
firmware. It thinks this is a holiday
party.
LUIS/BLAZE
And it’s clearly had enough of our
crisis planning.
13.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Honestly, same.
The song continues — a cheesy corporate anthem about synergy and
growth. KARINA/KATHERINE mockingly lip-syncs the chorus.
PEDRO/JAY adds air-drums. Laughter.
PEDRO/JAY (SINGING)
“We are the change we wish to
monetize!”
ALEX/BENNY
Stop, I’m going to choke.
CHAD/ANDRE manages to make the music stop.
ELENA/MIA
Whoever wrote that should be arrested.
CHAD/ANDRE
Alright, alright. 12 points
Eurovision. Let’s... pretend that
didn’t happen.
JACOB/RANDAL
Oh, we’re documenting this.
KARINA/KATHERINE
I already added it to the crisis
report.
The group dissolves into shared laughter. A beat of comic relief
in a tense afternoon.
Then: back to the whiteboard.
CHAD/ANDRE exits.
The room settles. Laughter fades. They look around at the chaos
of diagrams and notes.
JACOB/RANDAL
That glitch... weirdly captured
corporate life.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Performative, flashy, and completely
offbeat.
PEDRO/JAY
With a hint of breakdown.
ELENA/MIA
Maybe that’s why it felt honest.
14.
ALEX/BENNY
Or maybe we just needed to laugh
again.
ELENA/MIA
It showed how fragile all this is. One
error, and the illusion breaks.
LUIS/BLAZE
Like us. That was the illusion. This
is the reality.
JACOB/RANDAL
But it’s also proof we’re all
connected.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Then maybe the illusion’s worth
maintaining. If it keeps us human.
A moment.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Damn. That's almost poetic.
PEDRO/JAY
Can we put that on the mission
statement?
JACOB/RANDAL
Already on the board.
They share a quieter look. A new kind of trust lingers.
Something built from both laughter and truth.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (O.S.)
Ten minutes left.
LUIS/BLAZE
He speaks!
KRASTYO/NATHAN
What do you want to leave behind?
JACOB/RANDAL
In life?
KRASTYO / NATHAN
Maybe. But perhaps just from today
will do for now.
ELENA/MIA
A different story.
15.
PEDRO/JAY
One we choose.
INT. BREAK ROOM – THE STORM 10 BEFORE THE SETTLE 10
The group is quiet. Not tense — contemplative. PEDRO/JAY tosses
a stress ball against the wall. JACOB/RANDAL adjusts his
glasses, again.
JACOB/RANDAL
Ever think about what you'd be doing
if you hadn't ended up here today?
ELENA/MIA
Running a meeting. Pretending it
matters.
PEDRO/JAY
Selling a dream. That I don’t even buy
into anymore.
ALEX/BENNY
I’d still be in the mailroom,
alphabetizing names I can't pronounce.
LUIS/BLAZE
I’d probably be somewhere not talking.
To anyone.
KARINA/KATHERINE
I'd be sketching. Alone. Just like
here, but with less coffee.
VALENTIN/ERIC
I’d be in Photoshop, smoothing over
someone else's lies.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (FROM CORNER)
You all just described... every day
outside this room.
Beat.
PEDRO/JAY
Damn.
11 INT. BREAK ROOM – MOMENTS LATER 11
CHAD/ANDRE is back in the center of the room
16.
CHAD/ANDRE
Now we are going to try something new:
paired dialogues.
LUIS/BLAZE
For F’sake!
CHAD/ANDRE
It’s important! (Beat). Share.
Listen. Write what you learn.
PEDRO/JAY
Is this marriage counseling?
CHAD/ANDRE
Call it workplace intimacy.
LUIS/BLAZE
Can I pick my partner?
ELENA/MIA
Is that because no one would pick
you?
He smiles at her. She knows that got to him.
CHAD/ANDRE
I will choose.
INT. BREAK ROOM – CORNER TABLE – KARINA/KATHERINE 12 AND PEDRO1/2JAY
PEDRO/JAY
I bet you draw people better than they
are.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Only the ones who pretend they’re not
broken.
PEDRO/JAY
So, me?
KARINA/KATHERINE
You’re more cracked than broken.
Cracks are more interesting.
He touches her hair.
PEDRO/JAY
I agree.
She looks at him.
17.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Seems like you cracked it.
A moment between them.
INT. BREAK ROOM – SIDE NOOK – ELENA/13 MIA AND LUIS/BLAZE 13
They sit knee to knee, uncomfortable.
ELENA/MIA
This feels like forced vulnerability.
LUIS/BLAZE
My specialty.
(beat)
What scares you?
ELENA/MIA
Not being perfect.
LUIS/BLAZE
You're not. But you pull it off.
ELENA/MIA
What about you?
LUIS/BLAZE
That I’ll get used to being who I am.
Their eyes lock. A beat too long. Something real.
14 INT. BREAK ROOM – OUTSIDE THE DOOR – JACOB/RANDAL AND ALEX/1B4ENNY
They’ve stepped out, pretending to get water.
ALEX/BENNY
I hate these exercises.
JACOB/RANDAL
Same. Want to answer the question
without asking it?
ALEX/BENNY
You go first.
JACOB/RANDAL
I’m terrified I peaked in high school.
ALEX/BENNY
I’m scared I haven’t peaked yet.
A quiet chuckle. Then silence.
18.
INT. BREAK ROOM – 15 MAIN SPACE – LATER 15
KRASTYO / NATHAN lingers by the AV cart, hesitant. He checks a
message on his phone:
He scrolls. A corporate directive email glows on the screen:
“EVALUATE TEAM DYNAMICS FOR POTENTIAL DOWNSIZING.”
He looks up — everyone still absorbed in the challenge.
JACOB/RANDAL and ALEX/BENNY head back into the Break room
where the others have gathered.
KRASTYO / NATHAN calls the group to attention.
KRASTYO / NATHAN
There’s something I need to say.
He walks to the center of the room, holding up his phone.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (CONT’D)
This was never just about bonding. The
company asked us to monitor
everything. For patterns. For
problems. For potential redundancies.
A sharp intake of breath. PEDRO/JAY steps forward.
PEDRO/JAY
So this was a test.
KRASTYO / NATHAN
It was.
ELENA/MIA
And now?
KRASTYO / NATHAN
Now I’m telling you. Before they make
me delete it all.
No one speaks. Then
JACOB/RANDAL
Wait—are they grading us?
KRASTYO/NATHAN (QUIET)
Possibly.
VALENTIN/ERIC
So some of us could be fired?
Krastyo/Nathan doesn’t say anything.
19.
KARINA/KATHERINE
You used our trust.
KRASTYO/NATHAN
I didn’t plan this.
VALENTIN/ERIC
But you didn’t stop it either.
A long silence.
LUIS/BLAZE
Well... at least we’re finally not
being lied to.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Too late to matter?
JACOB/RANDAL
Or just early enough to do something
about it.
The group exchanges a look. Hurt. Betrayal. But a pulse of
resolve.
INT. BREAK ROOM – WHITEBOARD – NOW 16 A MESS OF COLORS 16
KARINA/KATHERINE draws something else now — a single chair in
the center of chaos.
KARINA/KATHERINE
This one’s for whoever we pretend to
be when we’re alone.
ELENA/MIA
You sure that chair’s not on fire?
KARINA/KATHERINE
It will be when PEDRO/JAY sits in it.
PEDRO/JAY
I'll bring marshmallows.
A cute smile between them.
JACOB/RANDAL looks at the mess of the white board.
JACOB/RANDAL
We were supposed to write a mission
statement.
ELENA/MIA
I’d say we redefined the mission.
20.
PEDRO/JAY
Yeah. Mutual survival.
ALEX/BENNY
And no actual fatalities.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Yet.
Laughter.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Should we actually write something?
LUIS/BLAZE
Hell yeah. Let’s mess with their
expectations.
ELENA/MIA
Group-authored. No edits.
JACOB/RANDAL
Fuck it, I’ll type.
INT. BREAK ROOM – COMPUTER STATION 17 – MOMENTS LATER 17
JACOB/RANDAL types as they all huddle around a company laptop.
JACOB/RANDAL (READING)
"We were asked to find alignment. What
we found was friction, followed by
honesty."
PEDRO/JAY
"We didn’t choose each other. But we
chose to listen."
ELENA/MIA
"For a few hours, we became a team. No
titles, no job roles."
KARINA/KATHERINE
"Just eight messy, unfinished people."
ALEX/BENNY
"Trying to remember how to care."
VALENTIN/ERIC
"This is our mission statement."
LUIS/BLAZE
"And it’s probably the only one we’ll
mean."
21.
JACOB/RANDAL clicks “Save.” ALEX/BENNY adds an emoji to the
bottom of the doc. ELENA/MIA smirks, but doesn’t delete it.
JACOB/RANDAL
Okay. Done. For real.
ELENA/MIA
This feels like graduation. But for
cynics.
VALENTIN/ERIC
Corporate catharsis. Group-therapy
chic.
LUIS/BLAZE
It's something!
INT. BREAK ROOM – 18 CHAD/ANDRE RETURNS 18
CHAD/ANDRE re-enters with his clipboard, glancing at them. The
energy is different.
CHAD/ANDRE
You actually finished?
JACOB/RANDAL
We did. Want to read it?
CHAD/ANDRE (READING)
...Huh.
(beat)
I expected sarcasm. This is...
(another beat)
Good.
LUIS/BLAZE
(sarcastic) This has been such an
informative day. I’ve learned so
much!
ELENA/MIA gives the ‘stop it’ face. It’s a joke but is this
actually true from some of the people here.
CHAD/ANDRE
I can only imagine.
CHAD/ANDRE smiles. His job is done.
CHAD/ANDRE (CONT’D)
Right, you can all go home. And
think next time before you do
something stupid and put this
company in potential jeopardy.
22.
He eyes Krastyo/Nathan before grabbing the laptop and
sauntering out.
LUIS/BLAZE
I’m gonna miss him.
The group laugh. Even Krastyo/Nathan.
INT. BREAK 19 ROOM – DEPARTURE 19
They gather their things. Silences are full, not awkward. They
move with a new rhythm.
PEDRO/JAY
So... see you Monday?
ELENA/MIA
Depends who I am by then.
She smiles at Luis/Blaze. A mutual connection.
LUIS/BLAZE
I’ll probably still be an asshole.
But maybe less.
KARINA/KATHERINE
Let’s not pretend this didn’t happen.
JACOB/RANDAL
If we still have a job and I see
you in the hallway. I promise I
will say hi.
A quiet nod between them.
ALEX/BENNY
(quietly) I saved a version of the
mission doc. Just in case.
They smile. Safety in numbers. A pact.
20 INT. HALLWAY – LATER 20
- KRASTYO / NATHAN remains behind, wiping the board slowly.
Reads their scribbled statement.
KRASTYO / NATHAN (SOFTLY)
“Trying to remember how to care.”
He smiles. Faint. Honest. Wipes the words off the board.
— ELENA/MIA and LUIS/BLAZE walk out side by side.
23.
— KARINA/KATHERINE and PEDRO/JAY exit, lingering by the
elevator.
— JACOB/RANDAL and ALEX/BENNY grab coffee from the kitchen —
laughing.
— VALENTIN/ERIC holds the door open for KRASTYO / NATHAN
A small nod passes between them.
EXT. OFFICE 21 BUILDING – DAY 21
The group disperses into a busy world. The sun is just breaking
through the clouds.
JACOB/RANDAL (V.O.)
Dear corporate management, this
morning you asked who we were, we
didn’t know. But after today, we
have a better idea. PS. Fuck you
Andre.
FADE OUT
