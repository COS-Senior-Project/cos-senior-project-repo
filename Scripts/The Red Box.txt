EXT. UNDERWATER LAKE SARNISTA/ 1 BULGARIA - DAY 1 *
A slim, FEMALE HAND releases an open, red music box, from
which -- *
Tens of hand written letters float away -- the faint inky
words lost in the waters.
The music box rises toward the surface.
2 EXT. LAKE EDGE - DAY 2
A BULGARIAN FISHERMAN notices the music box, bobbing in the *
lake toward him. He scoops it up with a net. Pulls it from
the water, examines it.
Holding the music box, the fisherman studies and opens it to
reveal a tiny figurine in a traditional Bulgarian ballerina
dress. A mirror on the inside lid.
Looking into the mirror, the fisherman turns the handle.
A haunting yet beautiful melody plays. It features off-key
minor-key tritone, it disturbs more than it charms.
Instantly -- the fisherman’s eyes turn white. *
3 EXT. VARIOUS - DAY/ NIGHT 3
MONTAGE: Across two hundred years, the red music box passes *
between various pairs of hands:
- In the fisherman’s hut, his DEAD WIFE is slumped, twisted *
in the corner. Her eyes watching him aim a harpoon beneath *
his jaw. THWIP! Blood splatters against the hut’s wooden *
wall. On the floor -- the red music box. *
- A NUN enters the hut, winces at the stench. Horrified, she *
eyes the fly-riddled corpses before being drawn to the red *
music box. *
- In a church, the nun opens the music box. Turns the handle. *
Her eyes turn white. CUT TO: *
- A PRIEST steps from the church’s highest window. Suicide. *
- In the church, the nun hands the music box to a weeping *
WIDOW, sitting beside her SON. *
- At home, the widow opens the music box. Her eyes turn *
white. CUT TO: *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 1A.
- On the kitchen floor -- the widow’s SON laid dead, holding *
a knife -- blood seeping from a gash in his left wrist. *
- Distraught, the widow hides the music box beneath the *
living room floorboards. CUT TO: *
- In the kitchen, the widow bent over with her head in the *
oven. Dead from carbon monoxide poisoning. *
- Beneath the floorboards -- PUSH IN: On the red music box, *
on which dust gathers. Decades pass. Until -- light spills in *
as the floorboards open. A YOUNG BOY’s hand removes the box. *
He eyes the music box in awe. *
- The young boy presents the music box to his MOTHER, who *
holds the hand of her YOUNG DAUGHTER. *
- In the hold of a World War Two cargo ship, the young *
daughter sits traumatized between her dead mother and *
brother. *
- In an American house, the young girl lays dead, the music *
box open in her limp hand. Her FOSTER PARENTS laid dead in *
front of her. A bottle of spilled pills on the floor. *
- The music box is dumped into a cardboard box full of the *
young girl’s belongings. The cardboard box is sealed shut. *
- The cardboard box (containing the music box) is handed over *
the counter of an antique store to an ELDERLY STORE OWNER, *
who takes it to a back storage room. *
- Hold on the cardboard box. Time passes. Dust gathers. *
- Decades later, an elderly FEMALE HAND (MARIA) opens the *
cardboard box, and removes the music box. She eyes it in awe. *
- Maria wraps the music box as a gift. Smiles. Perfect. *
INT. KIM’S HOUSE/ LITTLE BOY’S 4 BEDROOM - NIGHT 4
The red music box rests on a chest of drawers.
5 INT. KIM’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 5
A little girl -- MILLIE -- white summer dress, sits -- palms
flat -- on the edge of a full bubble bath.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 2.
She lifts herself to sway her entire body back and forth like a
human swing.
Her mother KIM -- bursts in with some fresh towels, scaring
Millie, who almost falls into the bathwater.
KIM
(placing towels on the
radiator)
Careful, baby. Don’t do that.
Millie keeps swinging. Kim turns to Millie.
KIM (CONT’D)
(stern)
Hey.
Millie stops swinging on the bath’s edge. Sits there.
MILLIE
Sorry, Mommy.
Kim bends to Millie, who scoops a finger of bubbles from the
bath and dabs them on Millie’s nose.
Kim rubs noses with Millie, transferring the bubbles.
Millie giggles, scoops bubbles from the bath, puts them over her
eyes.
MILLIE (CONT’D)
(monster voice)
I’m going to get you in your sleep!
Kim feigns a scream, acting scared.
Millie laughs hysterically. Kim smiles.
From another room, she’s alerted by a BANG.
KIM
Bath time. Get undressed. Gimme two.
Millie holds two fingers in the air - ‘peace.’ Kim smiles.
Millie blows kisses. Kim blows kisses back.
INT. MILLIE AND GEORGE’S 6 BEDROOM - NIGHT 6
Kim steps in to see -- her little boy -- GEORGE -- asleep in
bed. Kim smiles softly.
Before she closes the door, she notices -- a red, leather bound
music box on the floor. The source of the earlier BANG.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 3.
Baffled, Kim picks up the music box. Moves over to the
adjacent Millie’s bed. Kim sits cross legged on it. Puts the
music box on her lap.
Opens it to find a tiny ballerina figurine. Kim turns the its
handle. The HAUNTING YET BEAUTIFUL MELODY plays.
MILLIE (O.S.)
Mommy, is that my present from *
Grandma and Grandpa!? *
Kim looks into the box’s mirror before -- BLACKNESS.
INT. UPSTAIRS 7 HALLWAY - NIGHT 7
The haunting melody plays out from Kim’s bedroom.
MILLIE (O.S.)
Mommy?
8 INT. GEORGE AND MILLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 8
Kim is asleep on the bed when --
The music box’s handle stops turning. The melody dies.
Water fills the music box, overflows.
Kim jolts awake. Baffled by the water flowing from the music
box.
9 INT. KIM’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 9
Kim rushes in. Horror hits her face at the sight. Her worst
nightmare.
A full, steaming bath, over which hangs -- Millie’s bloodless
LIMP HAND.
CUT TO BLACK:
10 EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ SUBURBIA - NIGHT 10
Unnerving silence over a lifeless street. One isolated house
has a porch featuring a swing chair.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 4.
EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ 11 BACK YARD - NIGHT 11
Uncut and unloved grass stretches far out into the darkness,
illuminated by the fairy-lit surrounding fence.
Oak trees tower like guardians over the house.
Perched in a particularly large tree is the pensive ZACH
DAINS. Wearing headphones, he listens to melodic metalcore
band ‘motions.’
Zach aims a digital SLR camera like a sniper rifle.
Through the viewfinder, we see --
He’s shooting photos of a FOX, lurking in the shadows of the
small cabin. Zach SNAPS the photo. Zach tries to snap another
photo but his camera dies. Damnit.
12 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 12 *
The bedside clock: 5:45am. In a king-sized bed is BELLA DAINS *
wearing an oversized KISS T-shirt. Big diamond wedding ring.
Hair tied up, an ever-warm expression. Beside her, MAX sleeps,
gripping a small black torch that isn’t turned on.
She absentmindedly strokes Max’ long hair as she reads a
newspaper article:
ON NEWSPAPER: Remembering the Ivanov Tragedy: Six months on --
Antique Store Owners Mourn their Grandchildren’s death after *
grieving Daughter’s Suicide.
Disturbed, Bella pulls her precious sleeping Max closer.
Zach enters, gripping his dead camera.
He sees Max asleep in his bed. Zach creeps toward his bedside,
loudly opens the drawer. More NOISE as he searches for
something.
Bella touches her lips... ‘shhhhh.’
From the drawer, Zach takes a tub labelled ‘Diazepam,’
removes a pill, downs it. He finds a USB-Charger, plugs it
into his camera.
*The parents talk quietly, so as not to wake Max.*
ZACH
Nightmares?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 5.
BELLA
Grandpa Bernie strikes again.
Guilt crawls across Zach’s face. He climbs into the bed next
to Max, who continues to sleep.
Zach eyes him sadly. Bella reaches over to rub Zach’s
shoulder, comforting him. He takes her hand, twisting the *
wedding ring on her finger, which he kisses. *
BELLA (CONT’D)
Catch any beauties?
Zach makes a zero shape with his fingers.
BELLA (CONT’D)
As in perfect or zero?
ZACH
Perfect zero.
Zach turns on the charging camera, flicks through.
ON SLR SCREEN: The fox’s eyes are illuminated, too dark to make
it out.
Frustrated, Zach dumps the camera on his bedside.
Bella presents the newspaper headline about the parents of the
dead mother.
BELLA
Can you even imagine?
Zach shakes his head. Keeps at his camera. Bella notices
something on the article.
BELLA (CONT’D)
Wait. They’re looking for a
photographer... to relaunch the
store. “A fresh start” apparently.
ZACH
It’s hardly Vogue.
BELLA
But worth a shot, no?
Zach shrugs - guess so -- he goes to stroke Max’s hair. Max
unconsciously bats him away.
ZACH
Even hates me in his sleep.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 5A.
Bella touches Zach’s face, consoling him.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 6.
BELLA
Until your tiny violin wakes him.
They share a smile.
BELLA (CONT’D)
Look at what you have. What’s a
paycheck without a family to enjoy
it with?
Bella winks. Kisses his cheek. *
13 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 13
EGGS flip in a pan. Rushing, Zach dumps them on a plate.
ZACH *
For thee.
Zach hands Bella the plate of eggs. Wearing power dressed
separates, she downs a coffee on her way to grabbing Max’s
school book bag.
BELLA
Just there, honey.
Zach doesn’t know where she means, places the plate on the
counter. Moves to a breakfast table, sits opposite --
Max -- school uniform - eating a bowl of Rice Krispies. Plays
‘Monster Battle’ on his iPad.
He’s chewing on an action figure, which Bella - snatches from
his hand, and puts on the counter, out of his reach.
Bella grabs a high-end leather bag, featuring a plaque: ‘DR.
BELLA DAINS.’
Zach works away at a laptop, editing a photo of a fox. His
frustration grows, can’t get it quite right.
Out of the window, Bella notices the unloved lawn.
BELLA (CONT’D)
Could you weed the lawn today?
ZACH
(working)
Thought I already did?
BELLA
That was last month, sweetie.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 7.
ZACH
(working)
You got it.
Bella spots a bag of chips on the counter, shoves them in
Max’s bag.
Zach, hyper-focused on editing, hasn’t noticed the milky mess
Max is making with his cereal.
Bella sees Max’s shoes are dirty. Grabs them. Cleans them in
the sink. The washing machine beeps. The kettle whistles.
Banal chaos.
Bella coughs for Zach’s attention. He’s too engulfed in his
editing -- doesn’t notice until she WHISTLES, jolting him as
if out of a trance. Zach gets her point...
ZACH (CONT’D)
So, Max... wanna come to a shoot
with me today? Maybe pick up a cool
antique?
Max ignores Zach, who shrugs at Bella - ‘See!’
BELLA
(softly) *
Bit soon for car rides, babe. *
Bella yanks wet clothes from the machine, then barely manages
to carry the huge haul of washing.
Noticing Bella’s struggle, Zach quickly ‘saves’ his work,
then tears himself away from his laptop to help --
Given his compulsion to rush, Zach inadvertently knocks over
his coffee, spilling it onto Max’s iPad, crashing his game.
ZACH
Sorry!
Max glares daggers at him. Zach arrests a ‘shit,’ quickly
grabs some kitchen roll from the counter. Cleans up the
coffee. Max scowls, unimpressed.
Bella shakes her head as she carries the washing toward the
door. A sock drops from the pile.
Zach grabs the sock, places it back on the pile. Doesn’t
realize coffee is still dripping from the table.
BELLA
Great! See that, sweetie? Daddy did
his ten percent for the month.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 8.
Max grabs a cloth, wipes the coffee from the table.
MAX
Ninety to go!
BELLA
Good maths! Teach him that will ya?
Might start contributing.
Max smiles proudly. Bella winks at Zach then kisses him on
the cheek.
She barely manages to open the door with her foot.
Zach’s phone buzzes. He takes it out. Reads the message.
ZACH
Oh shit. I got the Ivanov gig.
BELLA
Well done. Now get the door for me.
Zach opens the door for her.
ZACH
What would I do without my darling
high school sweetheart?
Bella throws him a ‘really?’ look. As she walks away --
BELLA
(mocking, demon voice)
Perish.
INT. IVANOV’S ANTIQUE STORE/ BACK 14 STORAGE ROOM - DAY 14
FLASH! SNAP! Zach, DSLR slung over his shoulder, uses a 35mm *
to shoot photos of the elderly ALEKSANDER and his wife MARIA. *
They pose, holding a sign that reads: ‘Ivanov’s Antiques.’ *
ANONYMOUS POV: Through a gap in the shelves we silently watch
Zach shoot more photos.
END POV.
As if sensing an eerie presence, Zach looks around
suspiciously.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 9.
INT. IVANOV’S 15 ANTIQUE STORE - DAY 15
Zach enters a store space filled with trinkets and unwanted
treasures. Aleksander follows Zach in, closes the door, *
leaving Maria in the storage room. *
ALEKSANDER *
You know, I used to play checkers
with your father, way back when. He
was a good man.
Zach smiles faintly.
Dismissively, Aleksander moves behind a counter featuring a *
small Bulgarian flag and a framed photo of KIM, MILLIE, and
GEORGE.
Aleksander quickly reaches beneath the counter and produces -- *
A cardboard box, from which he takes a handful of traditional
wooden toy figurines.
Amongst them, a cop, a doctor, grandparents, a farmer, a
fireman...
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
Sure your boy would love these.
ZACH
How do you know I have a -
Aleksander presents Zach’s iPhone. The wallpaper: Bella and *
Zach, with Max on his shoulders. Aleksander hands over the *
iPhone.
Zach pockets the iPhone, smiles. Nods a thank you.
Attentive viewers will note the the faint CRACKING noise from
the walls.
Aleksander shows the figures. *
ALEKSANDER *
So what d’ya say? Twenty bucks for
the job-lot.
The light flickers. Zach notices but Aleksander ignores it. *
ZACH
I’m not looking to buy anything.
But thank you.
From the box, Aleksander removes a traditional style MUSIC *
BOX, which we recognize from the opening prologue.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 10.
ALEKSANDER *
I’ll even throw in this...
The oldest antique we have, brought
over from my great Grandpa from the
old country.
Zach eyes the music box in Aleksander’s hands. *
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
I see the bags under your eyes.
Zach is taken aback, excuse me?
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
They’re as heavy as a death in the
family.
Zach frowns. In slo-mo, Aleksander HANDS OVER the music box. *
Zach takes it.
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
This... is peace in a box.
Zach studies the music box.
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
When you’re home, stare into the
mirror, turn the handle and let the
tune play out. All the way through.
You’ll be dreaming of apple pie in
seconds.
ZACH
I’m good. Honestly.
Zach goes to hand back the music box.
ALEKSANDER *
Screw it, free of charge. The whole
lot. Consider it a tip.
Zach smiles. Fine. He puts the music box in the cardboard
box, and takes it from the counter.
Zach sees Maria glaring at him through the glass hole in the *
back room door.
ZACH
Thank you.
Aleksander nods. The lights flicker again. Zach frowns. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 11.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I’ll be in touch about the photos.
Zach turns and leaves. Aleksander, drenched in hope and *
relief, watches Zach through the window, heading to his car.
INT. DAINS HOUSEHOLD/ 16 LIVING ROOM - DAY 16
Zach, camera hanging at his neck. Dumps the cardboard box by
the sofa.
Sits down, removes the red box. Opens and studies it. Checks
the underside. Opens it. Looks inside to see a circle of zigzags.
He eyes the ballerina, and surrounding zig-zag circle. Then
takes a photo of it.
17 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 17
Bella, red dress and lipstick, moves to the full length mirror
in the wardrobe’s sliding doors. Checks herself out. Max
shuffles in from the hallway, clutching an action figure.
MAX
I don’t want you to go.
Burying her guilt, Bella crouches to Max.
BELLA
I’ll be home for sleepy cuddles.
Max holds out his pinky. Bella links it.
MAX
It’s not the same without you.
BELLA
Baby. I get you’re still mad at daddy
but I promise it wasn’t his fault.
MAX
It was his fault! He wasn’t looking
at the road cause he was too busy
yelling at Grandpa!
Sensing Max’s stress, Bella cuddles and comforts him.
BELLA
We all make mistakes, babe. It’s
about how we learn from them.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 12.
MAX
And he still hasn’t built my
climbing frame!
BELLA
He will. And it’ll be the coolest
thing ever.
Max chews on his action figure. Bella takes it from him,
frowns at an echoed CRACKING noise, coming from the walls.
BELLA (CONT’D)
Boiler’s showing its age. Like
Daddy.
Max laughs, Bella laughs too then kisses his head.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS 18 HALLWAY - NIGHT 18
At the front door, Bella takes Zach’s hand.
BELLA
Not too long in the bath, okay?
ZACH
Don’t wet him after midnight.
Noted.
BELLA
And please don’t let him chew his
toys.
ZACH
Got it. No choking.
Bella throws him a look.
BELLA
Call me if you need anything.
ZACH
Like pizza, beer... hookers?
BELLA
And no editing. Go win him over.
Zach nods -- he’s not so hopeful.
BELLA (CONT’D)
(remembering)
Oh! Babe, could you please take a
look at the boiler? Keeps cracking,
or something.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 13.
Zach takes Bella in a hug. He whispers something in her ear
to trigger her naughty, knowing smile.
Bella plants a kiss on his lips. Opens the door, leaves. Like
he’s smitten in high school, Zach watches her walk to the
cab.
INT. 19 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 19
Max -- in his pjs and playing a monster slaying game on his
iPad -- slouches on a different couch to Zach, who --
Picks from a bowl of candy, watches Max playing with his *
wrestling figures. *
ZACH
Candy?
Max ignores him. Zach hears a CRACKING NOISE from the wall,
goes to listen. The sound has gone. He frowns, strange.
ZACH (CONT’D)
You prefer chips? I can grab you
some chips?
Max ignores him, keeps at his iPad.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Pizza? I know you love pepperoni.
Max shakes his head. Zach moves to beside the sofa.
Grabs the cardboard box of toys from the antique store.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Now we’re talking.
Zach opens the box, removes the cop doll, the doctor doll.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Wanna be the cop? Or super doctor
like mom!?
MAX
More like super lame.
Zach gets lost in a memory.
ZACH
I used to play these with these
kinds of toys with your Grandpa -
Zach stops himself. Realizes he’s made a mistake.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 14.
MAX
Before you killed him?
Zach stares at him, anger building.
ZACH
Enough. Bed time.
MAX
Mom said I can have a late night.
ZACH
Mom’s not here. Bedtime.
Max huffs, gets up. Storms past him. Slams the door.
Leaving Zach drenched in frustration. He eyes his camera on
the arm of the chair. A source of comfort and escape.
INT. ZACH’S 20 OFFICE - NIGHT 20
A wall clock reads: 10:30pm. Zach at his desk, above which:
A framed college of photos of his late father in various
situations. Christmas, birthdays, with Max at the beach.’
Listening to ‘motions’ on his headphones Zach edits photos of
the elderly couple, Aleksander and Maria. *
Zach uses ‘Photoshop’ to edit out a baffling black mist,
floating behind the couple.
MAX (O.S.)
I can’t sleep.
Zach doesn’t hear him. Max grabs a cushion from the floor.
Tosses it at Zach, who jolts. Removes his headphones to see --
Max in the doorway. He’s clutching a controller for the
remote truck at his feet.
Zach gets up, moves to Max, walks away with him toward --
ZACH
You know we’d sell the house if
Grandpa was really in the closet,
right?
MAX
Can I have a gun, just incase?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 15.
ZACH
No. I bought you a torch, what more *
do you want? *
INT. MAX’S 21 BEDROOM - NIGHT 21
A lava lamp nightlight on a bedside table. A walk in closet.
Various plushes and action figures. A ball-bat and mitt.
Zach -- holding the music box -- is sitting on Max’s bed.
Max grips the bedsheets tight, up to his chin. He’s gripping
his small black torch (switched on.)
ZACH
Okay, here’s the deal. If it
doesn’t work... I buy you a new
toy. And not a lame wooden one. Or *
a torch. A cool one. Like a video *
game.
Max eyes him to see if he’s lying.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I promise this is going to be
awesome.
MAX
Looks creepy.
ZACH
Sometimes we just gotta face our
fears.
Max turns away to face away from the opposite closet.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Okay. Fine. I wanted to take all
the credit... but this is actually
a gift from mommy.
MAX
Really?
ZACH
Really. She’ll try anything to help
you sleep.
Max softens. Relents -- fine - takes the box from Zach. He
begins turning the music box’s handle, triggering the
haunting melody.
He opens the box’s lid.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 16.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Look into the mirror.
Max looks into the mirror.
MAX
Nothing’s happening.
ZACH
Hang tight, we need to wait for it
to finish.
He points to his eyes then to the mirror. Max, over it, keeps
his eyes on the mirror.
Zach eyes Max, waits impatiently. Cynicism growing. He’s
distracted by the music box when --
Its handle abruptly stops. The music dies. When Zach turns
back to Max -- he is fast asleep. Snoring softly.
Zach eyes the music box in awe. Can’t believe his luck. He
silently creeps out of the room, taking the music box with
him.
INT. UPSTAIRS 22 HALLWAY - NIGHT 22
Zach opens the boiler cupboard beside Max’s room. Checks the
boiler. Taps the boiler. Nothing happens. No cracking noise.
23 INT. ZACH’S OFFICE - NIGHT 23
At his desk, Zach’s head in his arms. Asleep. Unfinished
photos of Aleksander and Maria on his monitor. *
24 INT. DAINS HOUSEHOLD/ DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 24
Bella enters, slips out of her shoes.
25 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 25
Bella peers in to see the sink full of dishes, open pizza
boxes still on the counter. Not a single effort made. But
right now, Bella doesn’t care.
26 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 26
Dim light bleeds up from downstairs. Bella walks up the *
stairs. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 17.
Sneaks unknowingly past the remote controlled truck at the
top of the stairs --
INT. DAINS HOUSEHOLD/ MAX'S 27 BEDROOM - NIGHT 27
Bella quietly opens the door. Sees Max fast asleep. Smiles.
Leaves. She doesn’t see -- behind Max, a subtle mould on the *
wall. *
28 INT. ZACH’S OFFICE - NIGHT 28
Bella nudges open the door, sees Zach asleep. Grins
knowingly.
29 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 29
Bella enters, unzips her dress. mirror. Props herself against
the walk-in-wardrobe’s mirror to --
Don a red, silk gown. She teases her reflection.
Smirks, mischievous. She’s left her faculties at the bar.
And she’s set to wake Zach for a hot night to remember.
Silence makes way for the now familiar but louder and more
unsettling CRACKING noise.
Bella frowns at the noise. Leaves the room to investigate.
The CRACKING continues -- morphing into --
BEGIN DREAM SEQUENCE:
30 INT. ZACH’S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 30
The noise of the engine. Zach, driving at speed, repeatedly
turns to Max and GRANDPA BERNIE in the back of the car.
A pile of 35MM cameras on the passenger seat.
GRANDPA
No-one said you’re not busy, son,
it’s about prioritization!
ZACH
That’s rich, Dad. Real rich.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 18.
GRANDPA
So learn from my mistakes! The poor
kid just wants some time with his
father. Your work isn’t going
anywhere. But your family will.
ZACH
Why, cause I’m providing for them?
Grandpa shakes his head.
GRANDPA
Cause you’re a workaholic! Never
heard of the ripple effect?
ZACH
Maybe if they listened to me once
in a while. Goddamnit!
MAX
Please stop yelling!
Zach arrests a response. Eyes Max in the rearview.
MAX (CONT’D)
(pointing, terrified)
DAD!
BAM! Zach unknowingly pulls out from a junction as a TRUCK --
SMASHES into them from the side.
END DREAM SCENE.
INT. ZACH’S 31 OFFICE - NIGHT 31
The ear-shattering NOISE of the CRASH jolts Zach awake.
Silence. Zach looks around. A LOUD THUD from the hallway.
Inside the box, CRACK as the figure’s head TURNS one-eighty.
32 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 32
Max wakes too. Looks around, confused.
MAX
Mommy?
33 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 33
Zach leaves his office, heads toward Max’s room.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 19.
Stops at the top of the stairs. Beside the remote toy truck.
Suddenly his face changes. An expression of pure,
unadulterated terror and devastation.
Zach’s whole world collapsing before his eyes.
His glare is vacant.
His features frozen and numb, as if he’s lost all ability to
communicate or express.
In slow motion, his cellphone drops from his grip.
And bounces against the floor.
Max leaves his room. Sees what Zach sees -- his eyes
desperate and pleading. Incomprehensible distress.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS 34 HALLWAY - NIGHT 34
Bella's DEAD EXPRESSION. Her body twisted out of place like a
contortionist.
Her neck snapped at one eighty.
A pool of blood seeping out from beneath her head.
In the b.g. we hear the hair-raising cries and anguished
screams of her beloved husband and son.
35 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 35
Zach sits, expression vacant, on the couch, next to Max. The
boy’s only protection from meltdown is shock.
Opposite, a young COP -- OFFICER HAWKINS -- finishes making *
notes in her notepad. Chews gum. *
OFFICER HAWKINS *
Coroner tells me no signs of force or
trauma. *
Zach nods. Hawkins looks at him suspiciously. *
OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT’D) *
Healthy marriage? *
ZACH *
What’s that got to do with *
anything? And yeah, we did. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 19A.
OFFICER HAWKINS *
Bella was a doctor, yes? *
ZACH *
This isn’t some insurance scam! *
Hawkins eyes him. His hands together. His eyes red. *
OFFICER HAWKINS *
It looks accidental, but I’ll *
confirm after the autopsy. *
Zach nods, looks at Max, like he has no idea how to fix this. *
OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT’D) *
I’ll check in again after the *
funeral. *
Hawkins eyes Zach. Her suspicion rising by the second. *
35A INT. ZACH’S OFFICE - NIGHT 35A
Close in slowly on the music box, sitting upon Zach’s desk.
20.
The ballerina figure is looking straight ahead again, at us.
Closer and closer and closer. Until --
Its head SPLITS in half.
INT. MAX’S 36 BEDROOM - NIGHT 36
Darkness tempered by a dim night light on Max’s bedside. Max
lays in bed, facing the wall, wide awake. He’s gripping his
small black torch (turned on.)
Steam is emanating from his mouth.
In the b.g. we see Zach nudge open the door, checking on him.
Zach steps in, hugs himself, cold. Steam from his mouth.
Zach moves to the window, closes it. Moves back to the bed
where he spots a framed photo under the bedside table.
He quietly takes it: Max and Bella pulling a silly face.
Zach frowns. Removes the photo to see himself folded under,
ostracized from the moment.
A tear creeps from Zach’s eye, he touches Bella's face.
Lost in a memory, drenched in regret. Desperate for an
escape. Sensing a presence, he twists his neck to see --
A shadowed presence in the corner. He gingerly moves over --
removes his iPhone, flicks on its torch. Slowly lifts it to
illuminate --
A black hoodie hanging on the chair.
Relieved, Zach lowers his phone torch. Turns to Max in bed.
MAX
(whispered)
I promise, Mommy.
ZACH
What did you say?
Max doesn’t respond. Zach moves over, takes a seat on the
bed. Max doesn’t turn around.
ZACH (CONT’D)
You thought anymore about what we
talked about? Mommy’s funeral?
Max ignores him, holds the sheets up to his eyes.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 21.
Behind Zach, on the wall -- a bruise-like mould appears. *
INT. DAINS HOUSEHOLD/ 37 LIVING ROOM - DAY 37
Zach is pacing up and down, he’s on his iPhone. He downs two
Diazepam pills.
ZACH
(into iPhone)
Believe me, sis, I’ve tried. He
called it a death party. If you
could, I’d owe you big time.
Mid-call, Zach places a rug over the thin blood stain at the
bottom of the stairs.
38 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 38
Zach does his tie in the walk-in-wardrobe’s mirror.
He eyes the smudge of Bella’s hand print against the mirror.
He holds his hand against the print. Lowers his head. Hears
the DING-DONG of the doorbell downstairs.
39 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 39
Max is sitting on the bottom step of the stairs. The twisted
rug exposing a thin line of Bella’s blood between the
floorboards.
Zach, wearing a black suit and tie, moves down the stairs.
The doorbell rings again. Zach quickly takes the rug, places
it back over the blood.
Zach opens the front door to STACEY, hair up, nurse’s scrubs,
athletic. High energy, positive attitude.
She moves in, hugs Zach, who squeezes her tight.
STACEY
You both holding up?
Zach nods unconvincingly. Peels away from Stacey, who --
Checks him over. Adjusts his tie, brushes his shoulders.
Stacey eyes the surrounding mess.
22.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Least you’re clean.
Half empty cups of coffee, packets of uneaten chips. Clothes
strewn.
ZACH
It’s on my list.
STACEY
Yeah well don’t forget who’s on the
top...
EXT. DAINS HOUSEHOLD/ 40 BACK GARDEN - DAY 40
MAX’S SCREAMS. Not a scared shriek. A joyous one.
A super fun game of hide and seek with Stacey, who --
Plays along, pretending to not know Max is hiding behind a
tree, barely able to contain his laughter.
Stacey gets closer and closer and closer.
STACEY
Now where could he be?
Max struggles to hide a squeal. Stacey prowls the garden.
Max, hiding behind the tree, spots an opportunity across the
garden toward the --
41 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 41
Max rushes in toward a perfect spot behind the curtain.
Stacey looks around before Max SCURRIES from behind the
curtain. Stacey dives toward him.
STACEY
GOTCHA!
With Max in her arms, she rolls over, tickling him as he
screams.
They land with Max on top of her, pretending to pin her down
like a warrior. A clear parental connection between them.
MAX
I could come live with you.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 23.
STACEY
What would your daddy do without
his lil sidekick?
MAX
Sit in his office?
STACEY
I promise you, once you two get
through this... you’ll be closer
than ever.
Max doesn’t seem so sure.
MAX
I need to pee.
STACEY
So go. Shoo.
Max smiles then climbs off Stacey, who watches him go.
Behind Stacey, a shape twitches behind the curtain. *
She starts tidying around, picks up the cups, the packets...
INT. MASTER 42 BEDROOM - DAY 42
Max checks the hallway through the ajar door, then quietly
closes it.
He heads to the nearby dresser where a chair sits. He pulls
the chair toward the wardrobe, which he opens.
Max has no idea about the veil of black mist that hangs in
the air behind him. Or the darkened mould on the wall. *
He climbs onto the chair and reaches up. The music box is too
far away, so he yanks at a hanging sweater.
The music box drops from the wardrobe --
Onto the floor, along with -- Zach’s HANDGUN.
Panicked, Max leaps from the chair. Grabs the handgun, at
once in awe and afraid.
He climbs back onto the chair and quickly dumps it back in
the wardrobe.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 24.
He steps from the chair, grabs the music box.
The bedroom door opens to reveal Stacey, arms folded.
STACEY
Long pee.
MAX
I wanted to show you something.
Max presents the music box.
MAX (CONT’D)
It helps you sleep.
Stacey frowns then follows Max to the bed, where he sits.
Stacey takes a seat and goes to take the music box but Max
holds it to his chest.
MAX (CONT’D)
Just stare into the mirror.
STACEY
(handing back the box)
Please. Be my guest.
Max takes back the box in a vice like grip. He stares into
the mirror.
(Again, we don’t have view of what he sees in the mirror.)
Suddenly, Max’s eyes turn white. *
STACEY (CONT’D)
Max? Quit it!
Suddenly, a HISSING NOISE from the hallway alerts her.
She listens in. The music box’s melody overpowers the --
High-pitched seething noise. Stacey looks around, the lights
go out, and suddenly she’s alerted by --
A CRYING cloth bundled newborn in the middle of the room.
Stacey gingerly and with trepidation heads toward the newborn
to and picks it up... it’s drenched in afterbirth.
But baby’s screaming stops as the cloths collapse into
Stacey’s arms.
Terrified, Stacey turns and --
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 25.
BAM! Max, eyes black as death, jolts toward her --
Panicked, Stacey closes the music box. Max GASPS awake.
MAX
Mommy?
Stacey, horrified to see the cloth bundle is still in her *
arms. Freaked, she drops it. *
Speechless, Stacey gets up and puts the music box back in the *
wardrobe.
STACEY
Your dad hid this for a reason. *
43 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 43
Stacey eyes Max through the ajar door to his bedroom. *
He’s fast asleep in bed. Stacey doesn’t see the shape move
slightly behind the curtains.
44 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 44
Stacey is pacing up and down, freaked, unsettled.
The room is a lot tidier than it was when she arrived.
BAM! A failed attempt to open the front door gives her a
scare.
She moves to the door, eyes the spy-hole then dislodges the
lock and chain.
Opens the door. Zach bursts in, black tie loose around his
neck, clearly drunk. Stacey steadies him. He stumbles.
STACEY
How was it?
Zach ignores her. Stumbles. She steadies him.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Free bar?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 26.
She sits him down.
ZACH
Was Max okay?
STACEY
Yeah. Weird shit aside.
ZACH
Weird shit?
Stacey preps herself to say this --
STACEY
(spitting it out)
Zach. There is something very, very
wrong with that fucking music box. *
I had this vision of... *
(struggling)
It was like a nightmare.
ZACH
Pretty fucking insensitive to prank
me don’t you think?
STACEY
I’m not! Wasn’t even me using it!
ZACH
It’s the melody, hypnosis or
something. Who gives a shit?
Stacey goes to respond but Zach slumps onto the chair.
ZACH (CONT’D)
It should have been me.
Zach starts crying before he COLLAPSES into Stacey’s arms.
A severe outpouring of anguish and emotion.
Stacey isn’t used to this, but she comforts him.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I shouldn’t be here. She should.
Zach cries into Stacey’s shoulder. She is drenched in worry.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 27.
INT. 45 LIVING ROOM - LATER 45
Zach sleeps on the couch. Stacey places a glass of water, and
a pack of Aspirin on the coffee table.
She drapes a blanket over Zach, tucks him in.
She sticks a post-it to the edge of the coffee table:
‘HAD TO HEAD TO WORK. WILL CHECK IN L8R <3.’
Stacey leaves through the front door.
46 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 46
Max stirs, tosses and turns in bed. Unable to sleep. Using
his small black torch, he illuminates the photo of Bella on
his bedside. His anguish palpable.
47 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 47
Max creeps toward Zach’s bedroom.
Peaks down between the bannister, into the living room to see
Zach asleep on the couch.
48 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 48
Max, standing on the chair, reaches up for the music box.
49 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 49
Max re-enters, holding the music box. He sits on the bed.
Looks in the box’s mirror and --
Starts cranking the handle, creating a cracking noise that’s
louder with every turn -- triggering the haunting MELODY.
Max’s eyes turn white. He’s transfixed by the box’s mirror *
before he -- SMILES.
50 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 50
The haunting melody from upstairs causes Zach to jerk awake
on the couch.
He holds his head in pain, hungover. Half asleep.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 28.
CRACK! As he turns the lid of the Diazepam bottle. Downs with
some water before --
He looks around to see --
The entire cast of WOODEN FIGURES standing in various spots
around the room. Staring at him.
CRACK. Slowly, Zach gets to his feet. Steps with trepidation
between the figures as --
CRACK.
A pulsating red glow of a dark room comes over the space.
Unnerved, Zach reaches the stairs when --
DEAD GRANDPA (O.S.)
I told you to tidy your shit!
Zach turns to see the back of his FATHER (MAX’S DEAD
GRANDPA), sitting on the couch, facing the TV.
CRACK as his father TURNS his head to realize -- his face his
bashed and battered, rotted skin, and glaring right at Zach.
DEAD GRANDPA (CONT’D)
You were a terrible son. An even
worse father!
Terrified, Zach glares at his father as he backs away.
Dead Grandpa aches to his feet -- his bones CRACKING with
every movement. He limps after Zach, who --
INT. 51 STAIRWELL - NIGHT 51
Zach, terrified, sprints up the stairs. Dead Grandpa limps
after him. Grabbing at Zach’s ankles.
52 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 52
Zach bursts in, slams the door, to see Max entranced by the
music box. The haunting melody in full flow.
The various lava lamps are flashing, like a twisted rave.
Grandpa’s footsteps can be heard -- ever nearing -- up the
stairs. Closer and closer. Zach yanks the bedside table over
the door.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 29.
INT. UPSTAIRS 53 HALLWAY - NIGHT 53
Dead Grandpa limps toward Max’s room.
54 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 54
Zach grabs Max by the arms, desperate to snap him out of his
trance.
Max doesn’t hear him, he’s in a trance-like state, eyes
white. He’s SMILING EUPHORICALLY. Hands clasped tight around *
the music box.
Zach tries to grab the music box but Max’s grip around it is
too strong.
With all his might, Zach tries and fails to snatch the music
box. Grandpa’s nearing footsteps. BANGING on the door.
Zach tries again to grab the box. Still, Max’s grip on the
box is too great.
The doorknob TURNS. Grandpa’s force pushes the bedside table
away. He’s about to enter.
The door opens to reveal no-one is there.
Zach desperately tries to close the box but it’s no use.
BANG! BANG! BANG! On the closet.
Terrified, Zach quits trying to grab the music box and turns
to the closet.
BANG! BANG! BANG! Again on the closet.
Zach gets up and moves to the closet.
BANG! BANG! BANG! More banging on the closet.
Zach turns to Max, trance-like, still gripping the music box.
Zach turns back to the closet. Reaches for the handle, grabs
it and pulls the door across.
Nothing out of the ordinary. Hanging clothes. Quilts and
pillows on the internal floorspace.
Zach moves aside the hanging clothes. Nothing there. Crouches
to move aside the quilts and pillows. Nothing.
Zach frowns, turns back to Max.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 30.
BAM! From the quilts in the closet -- GRANDPA’S ROTTED HAND
grabs Zach’s calf. Digs in his yellow finger nails.
Screeching, Zach tries to pull away.
Grandpa’s hand grips Zach’s calf harder then YANKS him to the
floor and --
PULLS him into the closet, into the mass of sheets and
quilts.
Suddenly, Dead Grandpa clambers from the closet and ambles
toward Max, who’s still entranced, gripping the music box.
Arms outstretched, Dead Grandpa leers over Max. Ready to grab
him when --
SMACK! Zach wraps the ball-bat around Grandpa’s skull,
causing him to STALL. *
BLACK MATTER oozes from his mouth and drips onto Max, who -- *
looks up from the music box before --
Horrified, Zach desperately snaps shut the music box in Max’s
grip, killing the melody.
Dead Grandpa is nowhere to be seen.
Max is terrified to see he has black matter on his skin. Zach *
can’t believe what he’s just witnessed. Beyond fear.
ZACH
(horrified)
Like Aunt Stacey said.
Deeply disturbed, Zach checks over Max, wipes away black
matter from Max’s face and body. Max is silent.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Say something for me.
MAX
Something for me.
Freaked the fuck out, Zach picks Max up, leaves the room.
Looks back. Shuts the door
INT. MASTER 55 BEDROOM - NIGHT 55
Zach, sitting on the bed, checks his own calf. Grandpa’s
finger marks have caused a dark rash.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 31.
Max, in his fresh PJs, hair wet, all clean, sits beside him. *
Clutching his knees, freaked, silent.
ZACH
So much for not getting wet after
midnight.
Max stares into space. Zach notices Max has a faint rash on
his neck.
ZACH (CONT’D)
(intrigued) *
What did you see?
Max looks at Zach, like he’s not supposed to answer.
Drawn to the box, Zach takes the music box from the bedside *
and eyes it. As if he can’t resist, he opens it. *
MAX
(worried)
What are you doing?
ZACH
Finding out what you saw.
Zach looks into the lid’s mirror to see -- *
His own reflection. He turns the handle, triggering the
melody. He doubts himself, but knows he has to try it for
himself.
Max watches Zach glare into the music box. The melody plays,
and within seconds --
Zach becomes entranced by the unseen force he sees in the
box’s mirror.
MAX
Wait!
As if triggered by Zach’s use of the box --
A CROAKING NOISE from the hallway. Terrified, Max grabs the
bedsheets.
MAX (CONT’D)
Dad?
Zach is glued to the music box. Smiling at the mirror.
MAX (CONT’D)
Dad, please close it.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 31A.
The croaking gets louder, coupled with nearing footsteps.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 32.
MAX (CONT’D)
Dad! DAD PLEASE!
The footsteps and the croaking get louder and louder. Max is *
crying, terrified. Glaring at the ajar door. He turns -- *
BAM! GRANDPA is standing at the end of the bed. SMILING *
through a crimson mask of blood. He slides a shard of glass *
from his neck. Max backs away in terror. *
MAX (CONT’D) *
Daddy!? *
Zach keeps his grip on the music box, which Max tries to *
close but it’s no use. *
Grandpa, still smiling, crawls onto the bed toward Max, who -- *
Grabs a glass of water from the bedside. Tosses it over Zach, *
JOLTING him from his sleep. When Max turns back he sees -- *
Grandpa is gone. Zach sees Max’s terror. *
ZACH *
Jesus, you’re shaking. *
Max does his best to gather himself. *
MAX
Did you see her?
Amazed, Zach nods. He knows what he has to do.
56 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 56
Zach, carrying the box... opens the front door. Steps
outside.
57 EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 57
A trash can at the end of the driveway.
Zach moves from the the hooded porch with the box -- down the
driveway -- the moment he steps off the driveway -- he winces
in pain. He looks down at his arm to see a dark red rash.
He puts the box on the driveway, steps off the driveway onto
the sidewalk. Screeches in pain. Develops more of a rash.
ZACH
What the f-
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 32A.
Max’s SCREAM from inside causes him to rush back inside with
the box.
INT. 58 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 58
Gripping the box, Zach belts in to see Max, gripping his neck
in pain.
Zach moves over, gently pulls Max’s hand from his neck -- a
rash, similar to the one on Zach’s arm.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 33.
MAX
I don’t get it. How come Aunt
Stacey left okay?
ZACH
She said she didn’t use the box.
But it still messed with her... it
messed with me.
(remembering)
The ripple effect...
MAX
What does that mean?
ZACH
It doesn’t just... haunt... the
user -- maybe it locks in whoever
is near them. It’s trapped us...
MAX
Like a key?
ZACH
(understanding)
Like an addiction.
Zach grabs the box, bashes it against the floor. Causing --
Max to scream. Zach winces too. A burning rash on his arm,
and another on Max’s neck.
Zach glares at the music box in absolute terror.
59 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 59
Dishes piled high in the sink. The room, unloved.
Zach, clutching the music box, is on his iPhone -- waiting
for the recipient to answer the call.
Zach roots through printed articles. He finds one, fingers
the news story. The headline: ‘BURNING MEMORIES: Family
caught in suicide tragedy.’
‘In a poignant and unsettling detail, authorities discovered
a burnt photograph of Millie among Kim’s belongings. *
Investigators believe the act may have been a final, symbolic
gesture of grief.’
BEGIN FLASHBACK:
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 34.
INT. KIM’S HOUSE/ MILLIE’S 60 BEDROOM - NIGHT 60
Kim brings a handgun to her head. Tears streaming down her *
face. *
GEORGE (O.S.) *
MOMMY NO! *
BANG! *
A handgun loose in Kim’s lifeless hand, down which blood *
pours. In the b.g. a burning photo of Millie, on a stand -- *
against the anguished SCREAMS of George. *
GEORGE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
MOMMY! MOMMY WAKE UP! PLEASE!
END FLASHBACK. BACK TO SCENE.
61 INT. DAINS HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT 61
Disturbed, Zach looks up from the article. Eyes the music box
in front of him. Struggling to resist it’s pull.
ALF’S VOICE (V.O.)
(from iPhone)
Welcome to Ivanov’s Antiques.
Unfortunately we’re now closed.
We’ll look forward to seeing-
Zach, frustrated, cuts the call. He grabs the bottle of
Diazepam, opens it. Downs two.
62 INT. MAX’S BEDROOM - DAY 62
A DOCTOR pushes a wooden stick onto the tongue of Max, who sits
on the edge of his bed. Zach watches, desperate for answers.
The doctor uses the stethoscope on Max’s chest, listens to his
chest. He does the same to his back, then shines a torch in each
of his eyes. The full checkover.
DOCTOR
Any other strange occurrences?
Zach eyes Max, doesn’t trust him not to tell the truth.
ZACH
No... no.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 34A.
DOCTOR
Well there’s nothing wrong you both
physically... could certainly be
stress or anxiety related... Normal...
given the circumstances. Or it could
simply be an allergic reaction -- a
change in detergent perhaps.
35.
Zach nods. Eyes the music box on the chest of drawers. He
goes to speak, as if to reveal the truth. Decides not to.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
First step would be therapy. For both
of you.
Zach nods, getting it.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
The body has an interesting way of
telling us we need to get out more.
No harm in a holiday. Bit of TLC. A
distraction wouldn’t harm.
Zach smiles. The Doctor moves to leave. At the door, he
turns.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Bella truly was one of the best.
Zach nods sadly. The Doctor smiles sympathetically. Leaves.
INT. 63 MAX’S BEDROOM - DAY 63
Zach re-enters with the music box. Max is sitting up, about
to turn its handle.
Just in time, Zach snatches it from him. Max looks deflated.
ZACH
(attempting to distract)
You wanna hear a joke? You like
jokes, you used to like jokes.
Max says nothing. Keeps his eyes on the box on the fridge.
ZACH (CONT’D)
What’s a cat’s favorite color?
Max shrugs.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Purrrrrple.
Zach hopes for a reaction, a smirk even. But it doesn’t come.
ZACH (CONT’D)
That was funny right? Come on, you
gotta admit that was a good one.
Zach puts the box on the chest of drawers. Shrugs.
36.
MAX
How can we stop it?
Zach buries his deep concern to comfort Max.
ZACH
We ignore it.
Max doesn’t get it.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Doctors orders.
Zach smiles.
BEGIN PARENTING MONTAGE:
- Zach pours the Diazepam pills down the toilet. Flushes.
- Zach, wearing gardening gloves, yanks weeds from the lawn.
Uses sheers to trim the long grass along the fence.
- Zach tidies around, the cushions, the cup, the strewn
clothes. Dusts, hoovers, polishes. It revitalizes him.
- Zach washes the dishes. Wipes down the counter.
- Zach reads a bedtime story to Max. Zach finishes building
Max’s fifteen foot colorful climbing frame.
END MONTAGE.
INT. MASTER 64 BEDROOM - NIGHT 64
Max, asleep, snuggles into Zach, who lays awake, glaring at
the ceiling. Lost in a memory.
BEGIN MEMORY FLASHBACK.
65 EXT. ROAD - DAY 65
Smoke swirling from Zach’s upturned car. Folded like an
accordion.
Zach, battered and bruised -- crawls from the wreckage, which
he quickly turns back and reaches into --
ZACH
Max! Max, grab my hand!
MAX
I’m stuck!
37.
ZACH
I need you to wriggle free!
MAX
What about Grandpa!? He’s really
hurt!
ZACH
You gotta focus, son. Come on!
Terrified, Zach sees petrol dripping from the tank. He
reaches into the car.
MAX
After three okay? One, two...
END FLASHBACK. BACK TO SCENE.
INT. MASTER 66 BEDROOM - DAY 66
Zach SITS UP, as if hearing something.
BELLA (O.S.)
I knew you could do it. I’m so
proud of you, Zach. For being the
best dad Max could ever wish for.
Zach can’t believe what he’s hearing, shakes his head.
BELLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I love you, Zach.
Zach takes a pillow, pushes it over his head, to block out
the sound.
BELLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Come and take me. One last time.
Zach overwhelmed by temptation climbs out of bed.
67 INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 67
Zach creeps toward the stairwell. Downstairs he can he the
low thrum of the music box. A faint red glow cast across the
living room floor.
68 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 68
Absentmindedly, Zach reaches for the music box from the top
of the fridge.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 38.
INT. 69 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 69
Zach sits the music box down on the coffee table. Opens it.
BELLA (O.S.)
You deserve this, Zach.
On the floor, Zach notices Bella’s wedding ring. What the
hell? He reaches for it, eyes it in awe.
ZACH
Impossible.
He pockets the wedding ring as DARKNESS PULSATES around them.
Zach takes out his phone.
Zach looks in the box’s mirror, turns the handle. Eyes white -- *
he smiles.
BAM! The TV turns on at full volume.
70 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 70
Hearing the TV, Max jerks awake. Rubs his eyes - what the
heck?
71 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 71
Max heads down the stairs. He sees the back of Zach, who’s *
sitting crossed legged on the floor, child-like -- staring into
the box’s mirror.
ON TV: Zach and Bella’s wedding video PLAYS out on the screen.
He reaches for the remote, tries to turn off the TV.
Instead the volume grows louder and louder.
The wedding’s emotive music blasting through the room.
Behind the TV -- Bella's joyous laughter morphs into a HEINOUS
CACKLE.
Terrified, Max looks around for an answer.
ON TV: Bella, in her wedding dress, turns to face him, looking
outwardly from inside the TV. She SMACKS her palm at the inside
of the TV screen.
39.
TV BELLA
(from TV)
Max, help! Help me, baby! Help me!
Max looks in horror at the TV.
ON TV: Bella desperately bashes her fists at the inside of
screen until her knuckles CUT and BLEED.
Max’s fear is palpable as --
TV BELLA (CONT’D)
(from TV)
MAX! HELP ME! ZACH, BABY!?
ON TV: Bella SCREAMS. Still leathering fists at the inside of
the screen.
Max grabs the nearby remote, tries to turn off the TV.
Max looks around for something that will wake Zach.
72 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 72
Max rushes to the kitchen sink -- can’t reach the tap --
grabs a stool to climb on -- reaches to turn the tap --
The tap doesn’t work.
Afraid, Max climbs from the stool. Rushes to the fridge.
Nothing there.
73 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 73
Bella still bashing the inside of the TV --
Zach, still grinning, trembles.
Max jerks back, unnerved.
The music box pulsates in Zach’s hand.
MAX
Dad, please. Daddy! Wake up!
Max turns to the TV -- His mother on the other side of the
screen -- BASHING the glass, which is closer and closer to
smashing completely.
BELLA
LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 40.
Beyond terror, Max shakes his head.
MAX
(crying)
Stop it! Stop it, Mommy, please!
Beat.
The TV smashes outwards.
Max drops backwards.
The music box’s melody ENDS -- the ballerina stops turning --
Zach’s SNAPS into consciousness. Looks around at the smashes
glass.
Doesn’t see -- but hears behind him --
Max GROANS on the floor. Zach turns to Max, laying with a
shard of glass in his leg. Struggling in pain.
Zach rushes to Max. Goes to call ‘911.’
MAX (CONT’D)
(in pain)
No! They’ll take me away from the
box! It would kill me!
Zach’s frustration is palpable; he’s right. Panicked, he
calls ‘Stacey.’
INT. 74 BATHROOM - NIGHT 74
Zach in the doorway, watches --
Stacey, in her nurse’s scrubs, finishes up stitching Max’s
leg wound.
STACEY
Such a brave boy.
Stacey’s phone rings. She kills the call.
MAX
Can I go now? *
Zach nods. Max limps out of the room. Stacey turns to Zach.
STACEY
Wasn’t too deep. Bella must have
been looking out for him.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 41.
ZACH
About that.
INT. 75 DINING ROOM - LATER 75
Stacey, in shock, sits at the dinning table. She’s holding a
pen, a blank pad in front of her. Glaring at the music box.
ZACH
I tried already. No going past the
garden, the driveway. Strictly on
property. With or without it.
STACEY
An agoraphobic music box. Who knew.
ZACH
Not funny.
STACEY
A little funny.
Zach brushes the remaining glass into a trash can. Dumps it
in the kitchen.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Why did passing it on work for the
Ivanovs?
Zach takes a seat opposite Stacey.
ZACH
They clearly don’t have morals.
STACEY
So find a fucking murderer!
ZACH
Maybe they knew I was driving the
car.
STACEY
Here comes the pity party.
ZACH
What cause I don’t want anyone to
else fucking die?
STACEY
Ever think about Max in all this?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 42.
ZACH
I ONLY think about Max. You have no
fucking idea what it means to be a
parent.
Stunned.
STACEY
Really? You’re going there?
ZACH
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.
Stacey arrests tears.
ZACH (CONT’D)
It’s just... I already escaped
going down for manslaughter. Next
time I might not be so lucky.
Elbows on the table, Stacey runs her hands through her hair.
STACEY
If you won’t look up some scumbag
to pass it to... at least look up
an expert who can help you. Church,
police... dudes who bust ghosts.
Stacey’s phone rings again. She checks it.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Work. I need to go. ICU calls.
She gets up. Zach goes to grab the box. Stacey gets there
first.
ZACH
Wait!
Too late, Stacey leaves the room with the box.
STACEY
Imma go say bye to my bestie.
She leaves Zach uneasy and torn.
He grabs the pen, paper -- and his phone, into which he
starts humming the haunting melody.
INT. MAX’S 76 BEDROOM - NIGHT 76 *
Stacey knocks, then enters. Moves to Max, sitting innocently
on the bed. A bandage on his leg.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 43.
Stacey sits next to him, strokes his hair. Checks his chest
bandage.
STACEY
How we holding up, big man?
Slyly hands him an old Nokia cellphone. Taps her nose.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Here’s my number. If you feel
afraid... you text ‘DEN,’ okay?
Max smiles, nods.
MAX
Is dad okay?
Stacey smiles softly. She kisses his cheek, hugs him. Max
smiles gratefully. *
INT. 77 DINING ROOM - NIGHT 77
As if on the brink of discovery -- Zach uses a magnifying
glass to zoom into the printed photo he took yesterday -- of
the underside of the music box:
Using his phone, he snaps a photo of the image and uploads it
to a TRANSLATOR app.
TRANSLATOR VOICE
(from phone)
This Glagolitic text translates to:
Five, nine, fifteen, six, eighteen,
nine, fifteen, twenty, eighteen.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 44.
ON NOTEPAD: Zach writes 5,9,15,6,18,9,15,20,18.
Zach studies the sequence of numbers, then the written
Glagolitic equivalent. Beneath the number ‘5,’ he writes the
letter ‘D’ - beneath the number ‘9,’ writes the letter ‘I.’
INT. 78 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 78
Stacey, holding the music box, gives Zach a goodbye hug.
Peels away. Pen behind his ear, he’s holding the notepad.
Stacey’s phone rings again.u
STACEY
(re: work call)
I’m coming. Jesus! Can no-one else
pack a wound for chrissakes!?
ZACH
I looked into the box’s pattern.
Zach grabs the printed photos from the nearby coffee table, *
flicks through them to show Stacey. *
Reaches the photo he took of the box, when he first received
it. He zooms in.
ZACH (CONT’D)
See... it’s a code.
Zach shows a pen-written word on his hand: “Dioecious.”
Stacey grabs the pen from behind Zach’s and draws an arrow
protruding from the word’s ‘o’ and a cross protruding from
the second ‘o.’ The male and female symbols.
STACEY
It means male and female.
Zach produces his phone.
ZACH
And the melody...
He produces his iPhone, a DSP app plays the song: ‘Dance with
Death.’
The eastern European tune plays out in Bulgarian.
STACEY
Catchy.
Zach reads from the notepad. Stacey’s phone buzzes. She
checks it.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 45.
ZACH
It translates to... ‘Sacrifice.
Dance with death, a worthy partner.
A final bow. A solo act. I’ll turn
the weak insane. A living Hell
remains. Naked eyes won’t see me
save you.’
STACEY
I really gotta run. Do some
research. Local gangbangers,
burglars, drug dealers. Someone who
deserves this more than you.
Zach isn’t paying attention -- he’s staring at the 35MM
camera in his hand.
ZACH
(an idea)
Naked eyes won’t see me save you.
Stacey pats his back. He’s deep in thought.
STACEY
And don’t use it. I beg.
Zach grabs the 35MM camera. Stacey leaves.
INT. MAX’S 79 BEDROOM - NIGHT 79 *
Moonlight shines through the gap in the curtains. The various *
toys and cupboards casting shadows across the carpet and up *
the walls. *
Max’s torch (turned off) sits on a chest of drawers. *
Zach, 35MM camera hanging at his neck, and gripping the music
box, nudges Max, who wakes from a deep sleep.
The rashes and burns around Max’s neck appear to be ROTTING
and spreading onto his shoulders. Max moans with exhaustion.
Zach dabs Max’s rash and burns with anti-septic cream, then
pockets the cream -- just incase.
ZACH
Son, I need you to do something for
me.
Zach points to the camera hanging at his neck.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 45A.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Naked eyes might not see the
spirit... but a camera... Worth a
shot, right?
MAX
Please don’t make her more mad.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 46.
ZACH
Believe me... this isn’t the first
time I’ve pissed off your mom. *
*
80 OMITTED 80 *
*
81 INT. MAX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 81 *
Zach holds the music box up to Max’s eyes. It’s clear he *
doesn’t want to do this. He hesitates. Second thoughts. No, *
he has to. *
Zach moves to the bedside table, onto which he places the *
music box. *
Zach turns the music box’s handle, triggering the haunting *
MELODY (which plays out over the following scenes.) *
Max’s eyes turn white. His trance-like state. Bella in the *
music box’s mirror, smiling and waving. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 47.
Zach edges with trepidation to the middle of the room. Looks *
around at the toys and plushies.
DEAD GRANDPA (O.S.)
Why didn’t save me, son? Why did
you want me to die?
Horrified, Zach turns to see --
Dead Grandpa, sitting on a chair in the gloom of the corner.
A gash in the side of his head.
Dead Grandpa -- reaches out for Zach, who jerks back, shaking
his head.
DEAD GRANDPA (CONT’D)
Help... me...
Desperately holding his nerve, Zach takes the camera from *
around his neck and --
SNAPS a photo of Dead Grandpa, who bellows a LAUGH.
Zach turns in a circle, snapping multiple flash photos.
DEAD GRANDPA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Did you mean to kill Bella too? *
The figure’s split head TURNS to stare at Zach -- and -- *
-- as if by telekinesis -- blasts Zach back against the -- *
The chest of drawers, knocking him out. The force of the
collision moves the torch toward the edge of the drawers
before it --
TURNS OFF --- engulfing the room in moonlit semi-darkness. *
Grandpa is LAUGHING. *
(MORE)
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 48.
Zach, coming to, desperately reaches for Max, and the music
box, but he can’t move. He’s paralyzed. All he can do is
watch, from behind Max as -- *
From the floor, Max grabs a nearby wooden toy DOCTOR. *
Grandpa’s laugh grows more heinous. *
To Zach’s horror, watching helplessly from behind --
Max twists his neck to Zach. Max’s eyes turn PURE BLACK.
MAX
Let her take me, you murdering
cunt.
Max turns back away from Zach, who watches in horror --
Max slides the toy doctor into his mouth and down his throat.
Zach tries to scream but there is no sound. He twists his
neck to see the torch on the edge of the drawers.
Zach bashes his fist against the dresser behind him.
Max pushes the toy doctor into his throat. He chokes as Zach
bashes his fist against the dresser. Over and over.
Finally, the torch drops from drawers. Zach grabs the torch
and flicks it ON. Aims it at the music box’s mirror - causing
the light to reflect into Max’s eyes.
Max wakes from his trance with a GASP -- YANKS the toy doctor
from his throat.
Panicked, Zach rushes to Max. Holds him, kisses him.
INT. MASTER 82 BEDROOM - NIGHT 82
On the bed, Zach sits next to Max, who watches Zach flick
through the printed photos he took on his 35MM. *
Nothing out of the ordinary. Zach’s frustration grows. *
MAX
Guess we failed again.
Zach shakes his head. Deep in thought. Frustrated. Eyes the
cuts and bruises on his knuckles. Max’s throat bruising.
ZACH
(quoting the poem)
“I’ll turn the weak insane...
ZACH (CONT’D)
49.
a living hell remains.” The more we
use the box, the more it’s able to
affect reality.
Suddenly a phone buzzes. Zach reaches for his phone.
No message. A phone buzzes again. Zach turns to Max.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Do you have a phone?
Max shakes his head. Zach moves over. Another buzz.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Give me it.
Max reluctantly hands over the Nokia phone that Stacey gave
Max.
She’s messaged him: ‘REMEMBER SAFE WORD - DEN.’
MAX
Are you mad at Aunt Stacey?
Zach shakes his head. He knows she’s right.
ZACH
Course not.
A sad acceptance comes over Zach, who pockets the Nokia. He
produces his iPhone, into which he types: ‘Local
Parapsychologists.’
INT. 83 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 83
Zach, holding the music box, opens the door to JAKE BUCKLEY.
He’s rotund, unkempt, dresses like he hasn’t changed in days.
Zach involuntarily winces -- he smells as bad as he looks.
He holds out his hand for Zach to shake. Reluctantly he does.
ZACH
Thanks for stopping by.
JAKE
My pleasure.
Zach nods, gestures for Jake to take a seat. He does. Zach
sits opposite.
ZACH
Drink?
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 50.
JAKE
(re: the music box)
Holy shit, is that ornate casting?
Jake moves to inspect the music box.
JAKE (CONT’D)
May I?
Zach gestures -- of course. Jake takes the box, holds it to
eye level. Inspects it.
JAKE (CONT’D)
Fascinating. This is from the
golden age of mechanical music.
Zach watches him.
JAKE (CONT’D)
The zig zag pattern -- it’s very
specific -- Slavic... or Thracian,
if I’m not mistaken.
Jake points at Zach, snaps his fingers. Continues to stare in
wonder at the box. Zach considers his next words. Thoughts
swirling.
JAKE (CONT’D)
You tried it?
Zach considers telling the truth, shakes his head.
A tense beat.
JAKE (CONT’D)
So what do ya wanna know?
Zach stalls, appears to be changing his mind.
ZACH
Any history... myths. I’m...
writing a book. On haunted
artifacts.
JAKE
Coolio.
Jake takes out his phone. Checking something.
JAKE (CONT’D)
Lemme see. You signed the contract,
right?
Zach nods.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 51.
JAKE (CONT’D)
Any weird shit happened since you
got this?
ZACH
Like?
JAKE
Any dead relatives?
Zach mulls over his response. Jake eyes him suspiciously.
Then laughs.
JAKE (CONT’D)
I’m just busting your balls, man.
Changing the subject, Zach presents the ink-written word on
his hand: ‘Dioecious.’
ZACH
See this... it’s inscribed on the
underside. Any...
Zach stares at the word ‘Dioecious.’ Notices something.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Reason?
Jake smiles knowingly.
JAKE
It starts with a girl and a boy.
Zach frowns, confused. *
INT. 83A ARISTOCRAT HOUSE - DAY 83A *
A PEASANT GIRL scrubs the floor. The MAN OF THE HOUSE slaps *
her across the face then KICKS her. *
Curled in pain, she grabs a sponge then looks up in fear at a *
YOUNG MALE ARISTOCRAT, who -- takes her hand. *
JAKE (O.S.) *
A young peasant girl fell *
tragically in love with a teenage *
aristocrat. *
83B INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT 83B *
A jam-packed party of the filthy rich. The wealthy drink and *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 51A.
The man of the house and his ARISTOCRAT WIFE presents a *
BEAUTIFUL GIRL to the young male aristocrat, who rejects her. *
The aristocrat wife presents him another STUNNING GIRL. *
The young aristocrat rejects the stunning girl then looks to *
the back of the room to see -- the peasant girl. They share a *
smile - forbidden love. *
EXT. SARNISTA LAKE 84 (BULGARIA) - DAY 84 *
The young aristocrat waits by a lake before the peasant girl *
turns up. They kiss. A passing MAN sees them -- the couple
laugh, run away, giggling -- secretly in love.
JAKE (O.S.) *
A love so forbidden most of their *
communication was limited to
letters... that she hid in a music
box.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 52.
85 EXT. WATERFALL - DAY 85
The couple reach a waterfall, kiss again. Their passion,
palpable. The aristocrat boy presents the peasant girl with a *
ornate red music box. *
85A INT. ARISTOCRAT HOUSE/ BEDROOM - NIGHT 85A *
The peasant girl uses a scalpel to scrape an ancient language *
into the inside of the music box. *
JAKE (O.S.) *
A love so powerful it demanded a *
pact. No life without the other. *
She pricks her finger, then pricks the finger of the *
aristocrat boy. *
Their fingers touch. Their blood merges. They kiss. A pact. *
86 EXT. SARNISTA LAKE (BULGARIA) - DAY 86
The aristocrat girl, bereft, searches the same lake area for *
his peasant lover. She isn’t there.
JAKE (O.S.)
Then one day... she was gone.
87 EXT. ARISTOCRAT’S HOUSE/ BASEMENT - NIGHT 87
The peasant girl’s unheard screams as she pleas for release.
JAKE (O.S.)
Truth is, she was captured by the
aristocrat’s furious parents. *
88 EXT. ARISTOCRAT QUARTERS - DAY 88
The aristocrat boy screams in anguish.
JAKE (O.S.)
Desperate to end their affair, they
told their son his lover was dead.
89 EXT. SARNITSA LAKE - DAY 89
The peasant girl, searching for her lover, drops to her knees
when she sees --
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 52A.
JAKE (O.S.)
She was only let out when the boy
went missing. What she found next
changed everything.
The aristocrat, laid out on rocks by the lake -- a stream of
dried blood from his left wrist has dripped onto --
The upturned music box, spilling the girl’s letters.
The girl screams in distraught agony.
The girl, gripping the closed music box --
Walks into the lake -- beneath the water.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 53.
JAKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
She never returned. Destroyed by
grief... they say it twisted her
soul. And beneath the waters,
transformed her into a Samodiva.
INT. 90 IN THE LAKE - DAY 90 *
The peasant releases the open, red music box, from which -- *
Tens of hand written letters float away -- the faint inky
words lost in the waters.
The girl’s body twists and snaps. Her bones CRACK and SNAP as
she transforms into --
A HIDEOUS hag like woman with decrepit skin, large hook nose,
and beady eyes like black pocks deep in her face.
Rotted by death. A nightmarish version of the PEASANT GIRL --
this is the THE SAMODIVA, whose body -- *
DISSOLVES into a soul-like states and ENTERS the music box. *
JAKE (O.S.)
A spirit of vengeance, bound to
this box and the pain that put her
there. She’ll stop at nothing to
bestow the same suffering and grief
she feeds on. By killing its
owners’ most beloved, taking their
image and tempting their family to
the afterlife.
The music box rises toward the surface.
91 INT. DAINS HOUSE/ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 91
Zach digests the story. Jake grins, enjoying how disturbed
Zach is.
ZACH
Can it be... stopped?
JAKE
So... two ways to break the cycle.
ZACH
Give it away?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 53A.
JAKE
To someone grieving. Or... hold a
love token in your left hand, and --
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 54.
Jake puts a finger gun to his head. Pulls the trigger.
Zach frowns. Eyes the word ‘Dioecious’ on his hand.
ZACH
Love token? Like the peasant girl’s
letters...
JAKE
Exactly, or a family heirloom, that
kind of thing. Cool plot point,
right?
ZACH
How would suicide end it? I thought
it’s supposed to want death?
JAKE
It is. But only on its terms.
Control is key.
Zach is deep in thought.
JAKE (CONT’D)
This your first novel?
ZACH
Yeah! God loves a trier.
JAKE
(re: the music box)
If the book flops, you could always
sell this bad boy. Given it likely
didn’t even reach the states until
world war two... it’s surely worth
something.
Zach digests the information.
JAKE (CONT’D)
I’d love to give it a spin, if
that’s cool with you?
ZACH
Maybe not. Wouldn’t want it killing
any of your relatives.
Zach laughs nervously.
JAKE
Too late for that. Lost my Aunt
Beth recently. She practically
raised me. Bummer, to be honest.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 55.
ZACH
Do you believe it... the legend?
JAKE
Fuck no! But some of the crazy
fuckers I visit, they fall for my
stories like I’m reading from the
fucking stock exchange. Talk about
easy money.
Zach frowns - an idea hits. He glares at the box. Pulsating,
willing him to take it. But he’s so desperate to give it
away. So torn.
ZACH
I... I’d be happy for you to take
it.
JAKE
For real? Even though it could be
worth something?
Sweat trickles down Zach’s temple. Works hard to hold his
nerve.
ZACH
No, I barely paid ten bucks for it,
must be a fake. You can probably
get more joy from it than me.
Jake is amazed, but whatever, cool. He takes the box.
JAKE
Holy fuck. Thanks, man! My kids are
gonna love this! They love all that
creepy story shit.
ZACH
(off the word kids)
On second thoughts, maybe not. I...
I think my boy would be too upset.
JAKE
Come on, dude, are you serious?
ZACH
I need it back.
Zach goes to grab it from Jake, who holds it out of reach.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Give me the box.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 56.
JAKE
No. Fuck you. You haven’t even paid
me, bro.
ZACH
Give me the fucking box!
Jake yanks the box away so Zach HITS him with a hard right,
knocking him down.
Quickly, Zach grabs the music box -- which glows and pulsates
in his grip -- as if feeding off the negative energy.
Willing him to use it. He opens it.
INT. MAX’S 92 BEDROOM - NIGHT 92
The bedroom lights flicker. Max sits up from his bed.
93 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 93
Jake struggles to his feet, glaring at Zach --
Who’s entranced, eyes white, smiling at the music box’s *
mirror. Unable to help himself from staring into it.
JAKE
What the fuck?
In a flash -- a red glow comes over the room. Zach makes no
response, still gripping the box.
JAKE’S POV: Zach is --
Jake’s DEAD NANA in a hospital gown. Her toothless mouth wide
open, croaking. She holds both arms out, zombie like.
Saliva seeping from her mouth -- she reaches out for Jake,
who’s terrified.
JAKE (CONT’D)
Nana?
Jake shakes his head. Nana licks her flaking lips.
Trembling, Jake looks around for help.
Nana’s bones CRACK as she thunders toward Jake -- her arms
reaching out, she SHOVES Jake to the floor.
Pins him down, chokes him and prizes open his mouth -- a
STRING OF SALIVA lowering from her mouth and toward his.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 57.
Just out of reach, Jake spots a large shard of glass under
the coffee table. Quickly grabs it in panic. Wields it.
Nana chokes Jake as his fingers touch the shard. Jake loses
consciousness. Fading fast.
Seconds before passing out, he grabs the shard and in one
quick movement -- reverses Nana so that he’s mounting her --
about to STAB her with the shard.
BANG! Jake’s body goes limp. Drops to the floor.
Zach jerks out of his trance, snaps the music box shut to
see, beside him -- Jake -- Dead on the floor. Shot through
the chest.
In shocked horror, Zach turns to see Max -- holding the gun,
outstretched, aimed at Jake. He’s trembling.
Zach gets up, rushes to Max. Takes the gun, shoves it in his
jeans.
ZACH
What did I say to you!? No guns!
BEGIN FLASHBACK:
DEAD GRANDPA shoving a shard of glass toward Zach’s neck.
END FLASHBACK. BACK TO SCENE.
Max is staring in disbelief at Jake’s dead body.
MAX
(terrified)
That’s not Grandpa! I saw Grandpa!
I swear it was Grandpa! He was
trying to kill you! I promise!
Zach pulls the crying Max to him, kisses his head.
EXT. 94 BACK GARDEN - NIGHT 94
Zach drags Jake’s through the shadows toward the shed at the
back. He opens the shed. Dumps the corpse inside. Closes and
locks the shed door. Closes his eyes. Goes to throw up.
95 INT. ZACH’S OFFICE - NIGHT 95
Zach panic-flicks through a printed images of the 35MM photos
he took in Max’s bedroom. Nothing of note in the first few.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 58.
Neither Dead Grandpa nor the silhouette of the ballerina are
showing. Yet on one of the images, Zach notices something.
Zach grabs a nearby magnifying glass. Holds it to the printed
image. To his horror, he sees --
ON PHOTO: BLACK MIST in Max’s bedroom.
But the more Zach zooms in the more he’s able to see the
obscure outline of a person.
Zach having returned to the image, is too engrossed to
respond. It arrests his terrified gaze.
A shapeless FIGURE. Bella’s form forged in the blackness.
Staring right at the camera.
The HAUNTING MELODY playing from outside - the back yard. He
eyes his desk. The music box isn’t there.
96 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 96
Zach rushes to window and peels away the blinds to see --
97 EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ BACK YARD - NIGHT 97
DARKNESS. The faintest of activity in the shadows.
98 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 98
Zach peers out. Too dark.
Fear rising. He feels around. The wall - flicks a switch. *
99 EXT. BACK GARDEN - NIGHT 99
BAM! The light comes on.
Max -- sleep walking across the tall climbing frame. Gripping *
the music box -- eyes white, looking not in the box’s mirror *
but at the ground. Dark rash and burns spread down his arms. *
At the foot of the frame, DEAD DEAD GRANDPA, twists a
screwdriver at the frame’s foundation--
MAX’S POV: Bella, angelic in the glow of the movement sensor
light, is reaching up to him.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 59.
BELLA *
Jump, Max. It’s quiet down here. No
-one telling you you’re a bad boy.
For being a murderer like daddy.
We look at the shed. Then down -- the fall is high enough to
break our neck. At best.
END POV.
100 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 100
Zach darts away from the window and out of the room.
101 EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ BACK YARD - NIGHT 101
Max, entranced and gripping the music box, is standing at the
very edge of the fifteen-foot frame.
One more step and he falls.
Zach rushes out of the house. Dead Grandpa still at the foot
of the frame -- unscrewing the climbing frame --
The frame loosens, wobbles, Max, who’s -- on top of the frame
-- walking closer and closer to the edge.
Max reaches the edge of the frame. Ready to drop off.
With malicious intent, Dead Grandpa works at the frame --
causing it to break slightly.
With haste, Zach grabs the SHEERS propped against the fence.
Zach rushes to the bottom of the climbing frame toward the
Dead Grandpa. Grabs him. The old man turns the screwdriver on
Zach.
DEAD GRANDPA
Going to hurt me again?
Zach hesitates. Guilt rising. He wields the sheers. Dead
Grandpa holds out his arms, gestures for an embrace.
DEAD GRANDPA (CONT’D)
Give your old man a hug.
Zach shakes his head. No. Dead Dead Grandpa THRUSTS the
screwdriver at Zach.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 60.
Zach HACKS the sheers at Dead Grandpa, lodging it in his
chest. Dead Grandpa drops to the floor. Zach eyes him in
disbelief then --
Looks up to Max, on top of the climbing frame.
ZACH
Max. Max, wake up, son!
MAX’S POV: Bella is glowing angelically, arms reached out for
Max.
BELLA
Drop, baby, mommy will catch you!
Mommy loves you very much.
END POV.
Zach holds out his arms for Max.
ZACH
I’ll catch you, son!
Max steps off the frame at the same moment --
Zach catches Max, the music box still tight in his grip. Zach
snaps shut the music box.
Max’s eyes flutter open. He looks around, confused.
Zach embraces Max, who snuggles into him. Zach is drenched in
relief. Max cries into Zach’s arms.
MAX
Please don’t leave me anymore.
Zach nods, kisses Max’s head.
EXT. 102 FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 102
Zach and Max sit side-by-side, swaying softly on the swing.
The stars bright. The street is dead. Max is pale, gaunt,
arms covered in rashes. Dark shadows under his tired eyes.
Zach has the red box on his lap.
MAX
Am I going to go to jail?
61.
ZACH
No. But if anyone asks, including
the police, you tell them it was
self-defense, do you understand?
MAX
I understand I’m a murderer.
ZACH
He was trying to take the box. You
probably saved his kids’ life.
MAX
I made it worse her didn’t I? By
killing him. I made her stronger.
Zach turns to Max.
ZACH
It’s not a she. It’s an it.
Beat.
ZACH (CONT’D)
You know what I realized when we
learned your mom was pregnant?
MAX
That you didn’t wanna be a dad?
ZACH
Heck no! I realized that the only
way to truly make your mom happy...
was to make sure you were happy.
Max digests the revelation.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I never wanted to tell you this...
but when you were born...
Max looks at Zach, curiously concerned.
ZACH (CONT’D)
For a minute, things weren’t
looking so good. I’d have taken a
bullet for you to start breathing.
Max watches his dad relive the memory.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I’ve never cried so hard as the
first time I heard your voice.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 62.
Max takes his dad’s hand in his.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I should never have made you cry
again.
Max rests his head on his dad’s upper arm/ shoulder.
MAX
We all make mistakes. It’s about
how we learn from them.
Zach looks at Max. He recognizes that phrase.
MAX (CONT’D)
I forgive you. *
Zach kisses Max’s head.
MAX (CONT’D) *
Hey, Dad. What’s a cat’s favorite *
cereal? *
Zach has no idea. *
MAX (CONT’D) *
Mice Krispies. *
Zach smiles. Kisses Max’s head. *
MAX (CONT’D)
Would you still take a bullet for
me?
ZACH
Every day. Twice on a Sunday. *
MAX *
I don’t want you to. *
Beat. *
MAX (CONT’D) *
Why else would you have a gun? *
Zach takes Max’s hand. *
ZACH *
To protect you. *
MAX *
But you could have quit. You won, *
Dad. You’re still here. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 62A.
Realization flashes across Zach’s face. A spark of an idea. *
103 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 103
Max watches Zach, who plants the music box down in front of *
himself on the breakfast table. *
Zach sits and glares at the box. He looks ready, determined. *
Despite his sickness, his exhaustion. His spirit, unwavering.
ZACH
I won, right? *
Max smiles. *
Zach holds out his fist. Max bumps it. *
ZACH (CONT’D) *
A no. All it takes is a no. *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 63.
MAX *
You got this, Dad. *
Zach reaches over to carefully open the music box.
Fear crosses Max. Zach, laser-eyed, glares into the box’s *
mirror. A single twist of the handle triggers -- *
The haunting melody plays. BELLA appears in the music box’s *
mirror. She looks more beautiful than ever. *
Zach’s eyes fill with tears. His hand trembles. He shakes his *
head. Zach’s eyes flick to the gun on the nearby counter. *
BELLA *
Join me, baby. *
Zach shakes his head -- temptation stronger than ever. *
Max’s terror rises, willing his dad to resist. *
Zach’s temptation is destroying him. A war within himself as *
he forces himself to resist. Bella’s sad eyes in the music *
box’s mirror. *
BELLA (CONT’D) *
I love you, Zach. *
ZACH *
NO! *
With a SCREAM, Zach SLAMS the music box shut. *
Suddenly - his burns FADE. He gasps. *
MAX *
You did it. You won. *
Zach can’t believe it. *
ZACH *
Means nothing unless you can too. I *
still can’t break it, or take it *
away without hurting you. *
Suddenly, Max’s attention turns to -- *
BELLA’S VOICE (V.O.) *
I love you, Max. I miss you so
much.
ZACH *
You hear her? *
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 63A.
Max looks around the room, listening. *
BELLA’S VOICE (O.S.)
Come with me. Take the box.
ZACH *
Resist her, son. You can do this. *
Max’s eyes filling with tears, he’s desperate not to succumb *
to the urge. *
MAX
I can’t do it.
ZACH
Hey!
(locks Max’s eyes)
You got this.
Max nods. Knows what he has to do. Glares at the music box.
MAX
Leave me alone.
ZACH
Tell her, son.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 64.
Max reaches out toward the box.
BELLA’S VOICE (V.O.)
Good boy. A little further.
Max sits on his hands. He’s crying, screaming. A desperate, *
anguish laden scream.
MAX
LEAVE US ALONE! PLEASE LEAVE US
ALONE!
Max glares at the box as if it’s a fallen enemy, one he just
crushed. He can’t look away from the box, even though he *
clearly doesn’t want to. *
ZACH
Max?
Suddenly from the hallway -- the same thud as when Bella fell
down the stairs -- arrests Zach’s attention.
Without thought, Max grabs the box and flicks it open.
Zach turns from the hallway.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Max, no!
Too late. Max spins the handle, which triggers... *
BELLA appears in the box’s mirror. She’s crying, anguished,
begging for her son.
MAX
Mommy?
A BLACK MIST fills the mirror. *
BELLA *
Soon.
Zach lunges for the box.
But Max grabs it first in a vice-like grip.
MAX
NO! NOOOO! Mommy!
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 65.
Zach tries to wrestle the box from Max but it’s no use.
His eyes white. Unblinking. *
The music box is locked within his vice grip. *
The kitchen door OPENS. SLAMS SHUT. OPENS. SLAMS SHUT. Faster
and faster like a shutter film -- until --
Zach looks out of the kitchen window and we’re in --
EXT. 104 BACK GARDEN - DAY 104
A PRIEST stands at the wedding arch, silently addressing a room
full of around fifty WEDDING GUESTS, including Stacey.
A MUSICIAN plays the the music box’s haunting melody. *
Standing at the arch is Zach.
104A INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 104A *
Holding the box, Max unconsciously walks to the gun on the
counter, where he puts down the box. *
Zach is glaring, unaware, out of the window. Max grabs the
gun. He holds it to his head. His finger on the trigger.
104B EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY 104B *
At the arch, Zach turns to see -- BELLA in a wedding dress --
walking down the isle.
She is clutching NEWBORN MAX, blue, dead, drenched in
birthing fluid. His umbilical chord wrapped around his neck.
Bella smiles at Zach as if it’s the happiest day of her life.
ZACH
No. NOOOO!
At the last second, Zach PULLS himself from the vision.
END VISION.
BACK TO SCENE.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 66.
INT. DAINS HOUSE/ 105 KITCHEN - DAY 105
Max is about to blow his brains out, when --
MAX
Goodbye, Daddy.
Zach PUSHES down on the box, forcing the lid shut. *
The gun drops from Max’s grip.
The kitchen door stops banging. Max GASPS. Zach yanks away
the music box and holds it out of Max’s reach. *
Suddenly, the music box thrums - tempting.
MAX (CONT’D) *
I could just break it. Least now
you’d survive.
ZACH
Take that back. Never ever say that
again. Never think about it again!
MAX
Then it would never hurt anyone! *
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 67.
ZACH
You quit that talk, do you hear me?
That’s not the answer, okay?
Max nods, motivated by his dad’s words. Zach’s vision shifts
the newspaper article on the breakfast table:
‘BURNING MEMORIES: Family caught in suicide tragedy.’
ZACH (CONT’D)
(to himself)
Kim’s drawing of Millie. Maybe she
burnt it because she was trying to
stop her.
MAX
On my video game ‘Monster Battle,’
if you rip up a photo of the
monster, it makes it have less
health. Maybe if we had a picture
of her, we could do the same!
Zach takes Max’s face in his hands. Kisses his cheek.
INT. 106 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 106
Zach hovers over Max, on his ‘Monster Battle’ video game.
MAX
(reading from TV)
‘Legend has it that settlers in the
middle ages would burn ancient
drawings of demons in order to rid
certain spirits from their
households.’ Worth a shot, right?
Zach smiles.
107 INT. ZACH’S OFFICE - NIGHT 107
Max peers over the shoulder of Zach, who’s skimming through
printed photos of the presence.
Zach eyes the photo of the figure behind the mist. Bella’s
form -- forged in the blackness.
Max is glued to the photo. Zach grabs an over the shoulder
satchel, into which he dumps -- the closed music box.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 68.
INT. 108 DARK ROOM - NIGHT 108
Drenched in a deep red glow, Zach, wearing his music-box - *
carrying satchel, hangs the photo on a string line.
A 35MM camera hangs at his neck. *
Max peruses various hanging, abstract photos. *
MAX *
So cool. *
ZACH *
Film captures magic. Apparently. *
Max looks around at all the photos his dad has taken. Of
various animals in the nearby woodland:
Foxes, bats, foals. Even a bear.
Zach can’t hide his smile.
Zach takes out a lighter, flicks it on.
Then holds the flame to the glossy photo --
The image of black mist Bella sets alight, goes up in flames.
Max takes a step back, at once freaked and amazed.
MAX
Did it work!?
Zach gestures for Max to stay back.
The photo’s ashes drop to the ground.
And to Zach and Max’s horror...
From the ashes emerges a black mist, within which...
The image of BELLA forms.
Zach and Max step back, beyond the capacity for rationale.
MAX (CONT’D)
I think we’ve made a mistake.
Zach shakes his head.
Tears fill Max’s eyes. His legs like quivering bows.
MAX (CONT’D)
Mom?
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 68A.
Zach goes to talk but nothing comes out. He’s overcome by
emotion.
Bella morphs --- *
The shape of her legs.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 69.
Her body.
Her neck.
Her face.
She is wearing the same silk red gown she wore the night she
died. And she is utterly, and completely beautiful until --
With the CRACK of SNAPPING BONES.
Her shins, hands, chest, face. Each CRACK harder than the
last.
-- she contorts and transforms --
-- limb by limb, bone by bone, part by part into --
THE SAMODIVA.
Beyond terror, Zach stands in front of Max, protecting him.
Zach removes the gun from his jeans, nervously aims at the
Samodiva.
ZACH
Stay back!
The Samodiva steps forward. Zach SHOOTS at the Samovida -- *
zero affect. He tries again. Nothing. Shit. *
He plants the gun back in his jeans. Then --
Grabs the 35MM camera.
Before he can snap a photo, the Samodiva SNATCHES the camera
from around his neck. Tosses it at the wall.
The Samodiva LAUGHS manically.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Max, run.
Max stands there glaring in horror at the Samodiva. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
RUN!
The Samodiva snaps her vision to Max, who --
Limps out of the room.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 70.
The Samodiva lunges at Zach who dodges and belts out of the *
room.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS 109 HALLWAY - NIGHT 109
Zach SLAMS the door on the Samodiva.
Takes out a key and locks it.
He quickly gathers himself.
Then turns to --
The bottom of the stairs.
The Samodiva laid, contorted in exactly the same position
Bella was when she fell.
BAM! The Samodiva SNAPS her neck to look at Zach, who backs
off in terror.
Zach hears Max whimpering under the coffee table. It’s
closed.
He rushes over, crouches to Max.
Reaches out for his cowering son, who recoils further. Zach
checks behind him.
The Samodiva, nowhere to be seen.
ZACH
Come on!
Max, terrified, turns away. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
Look at me. Max, look at me.
Max reluctantly looks at his father.
ZACH (CONT’D)
I love you. I’m not going to let
anything happen to you. I promise.
Zach urges Max to comply.
BEGIN FLASHBACK:
A quick memory of Zach reaching for his FATHER from the carwreck.
His father’s trembling hand, desperately reaching.
Max pacing, crying behind him, praying he’s okay.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 71.
Grandpa’s hand stops trembling, goes limp. Max screams. He
starts HITTING Zach, an anguished, emotional breakdown.
END FLASHBACK.
BACK TO SCENE.
Still Max doesn’t move from beneath the coffee table.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Son. Give me your hand.
Max reluctantly holds out his hand.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Good boy.
Zach pulls Max from beneath the table.
Max SCREAMS. *
Zach quickly turns to see --
The Samodiva --
Jitters with purpose to Zach and Max.
She hisses as she looks down upon Max and Zach.
Max is beyond fear, looking away as he holds onto his father
for dear life.
The Samodiva's mouth is an inch from Max’s ear.
Zach presses Max’s face into his clavicle.
Steaming, black ooze slips from the Samodiva's lips. *
Her hissing vitriol causes Max to cover his ears.
Zach surreptitiously reaches into his bag for the music box,
opens it and --
SHOVES the mirror in the Samodiva’s face. *
The Samodiva SCREECHES then recoils onto the sofa.
The music box STEAMS, scolding hot, causing Zach to drop it.
En route, thick black smoke mist fills the space.
72.
Carrying Max, Zach holds his sweater over his mouth and nose,
avoiding the stench.
He wafts away the black mist to reveal --
The music box on the floor. Before Zach can grab it, he’s
stopped in his tracks on sight of --
BELLA --
Crawling from the foot of the stairs.
She isn’t undead, she isn’t decrepit.
This is Bella in her human form.
This is the Bella that Zach loves. His beautiful wife.
And she’s dying, desperately reaching out for help.
MAX
Mommy!
BELLA
Help me. Please, Zach. Help me!
Zach glares at her, gripped by temptation.
But he resists, grabs the box, now cooled down, and rushes
toward the door.
BELLA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Zach, please! I love you, Zach!
Too late -- Zach shakes his head, leaves.
BELLA (CONT’D)
(screaming)
ZACH!
EXT. DAINS HOUSE/ 110 DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 110
Carrying Max, Zach bursts from the house. Rushes toward the
car.
Max is fading, becoming weaker. Color draining from his face.
Rash and burns spreading over his cheeks and nose. His leg
wound, worse than ever. He’s in increasing pain.
Zach ushers Max into the back of the nearby parked car.
73.
INT. CAR 111 (PARKED) - NIGHT 111
Zach gets in the driver’s seat. Music box on his lap. He
turns the ignition.
A SCREAM: The metalcore band ‘motions’ BLASTS from the
speakers. Jolting Zach.
Zach turns it down, reverses the car off the driveway.
112 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 112
Zach’s car fires down the road.
113 INT. ZACH’S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 113
Zach drives, laser-focused on the road ahead.
Max, in the back, glaring out of the window.
MAX
Where are we going?
Zach eyes the rear-view.
114 EXT. IVANOV’S ANTIQUE STORE - NIGHT 114
Zach pulls the car up outside the store.
115 INT. ZACH’S CAR (PARKED) - NIGHT 115
From his jeans, Zach takes the handgun. Turns to the back
seat to see Max staring into space.
ZACH
Dad’s going to fix this okay?
Max makes no reply. Zach eyes the music box.
116 EXT. STREET OF STORES - NIGHT 116
Gripping the music box, Zach leaves the car, puts the gun
under his shirt and heads toward Ivanov's Antique Store.
He knocks on the front door.
ZACH
Open up!
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 74.
No answer. He knocks again.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Come on! Ain’t got all night!
INT. ZACH’S CAR 117 (PARKED) - NIGHT 117
In the back seat, Max reaches to the front seat for the music *
box. He glares at it with pure hatred. Vengeance in his eyes. *
118 EXT. STREET OF STORES - NIGHT 118
Gripping the music box, Max creeps away from the car to --
119 EXT. NEAR IVANOV’S ANTIQUE STORE - NIGHT 119
Max is holding a heavy rock. The closed music box on the
ground in front of him.
Max raises the rock over his head.
120 EXT. IVANOV’S ANTIQUE STORE - NIGHT 120
Zach bangs on last time on the door. No answer. Frustrated nois
answering, he pats his satchel. Opens it.
The music box has gone. How!?
Zach notices something in the store window’s reflection --
He turns to see --
His car door is open.
Shit.
He moves back to the car.
It’s empty.
Zach looks around.
Max is nowhere to be seen.
ZACH
Max!?
Nothing.
In the distance, he hears MAX’S CRY.
Blue Rev. (08/05/25) 75.
EXT. NEAR IVANOV’S ANTIQUE 121 STORE - NIGHT 121
Zach’s rushes over, horrified to see...
The rock beside the dented music box.
Max is laid out, barely conscious and a stream of black blood
is trickling from his eye.
MAX
(struggling)
I tried to stop her.
ZACH
Come here, baby boy.
Zach reaches down and scoops the fading Max into his arms.
Max’s rash and burns and leg wound, increasingly nasty.
Zach eyes the word ‘dioecious’ written in ink on his hand.
With his free hand, Zach grabs the music box, drops it into
his satchel, and heads back to --
122 EXT. STREET OF STORES - NIGHT 122
Zach, carrying Max, bashes on the antique store door. No
answer. Shit.
He produces his iPhone. Calls 9-1-1.
Through the antique store window, Zach sees a flash of
activity from inside.
Zach tries the door. Locked. He looks around at the empty
streets.
Makes a decision. He tries to call ‘Stacey’ - no signal.
Takes the Nokia from his pocket, it has a signal.
911 RESPONDER
9-1-1. Please state your emergency.
ZACH
(quickly, into iPhone)
My name is Zach Dains. I live at
forty three, Hampton Boulevard. I’m
calling to confess a murder.
Zach steps back, shoots the store door lock and heads inside.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 76.
INT. IVANOV’S ANTIQUE 123 STORE - NIGHT 123
Zach steps inside -- gun aimed, carrying Max. Sees no-one is
there --
Steps inside the back.
124 INT. BACK STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 124
Zach, gun aimed, carrying Max -- heads in.
Aleksander, standing behind the counter, aiming a shotgun at *
him.
ZACH
Put the gun down.
Aleksander ignores him. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
PUT IT DOWN!
Maria moves from the back, pushes down Aleksander's shotgun. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
We need to talk.
125 INT. BACK STORAGE ROOM - LATER 125
At a table, Zach, Max on his knee, aims his gun at Aleksander *
and Maria opposite. The music box between them on the table. *
Aleksander nurses a glass of whisky. He takes a shot. *
Aleksander pushes the box across the table. *
ALEKSANDER *
I can’t take it back. It doesn’t
work like that. You can only pass
it to someone new, who’s grieving.
Zach’s devastation is palpable. Aleksander downs the whisky. *
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
A stowaway family brought it over *
from Bulgaria. I assume that’s why *
it landed here. *
Zach listens attentively. Aleksander points to a tidy stack *
of antiques in the corner.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 77.
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
It was amongst the family’s things. *
My grandfather dumped it, right *
over there. Never spoke of it. Not
once.
MARIA *
I didn’t even find the god forsaken
thing until last year.
ALEKSANDER *
If we’d have known, we’d have never
given it to our granddaughter.
ZACH
Bullshit! You checked the fucking
obituaries, lied about knowing my
father. You knew I was grieving so
you hired me to fuck up our lives
to save your own! Despite knowing I
have a family!
ALEKSANDER *
I had to protect my wife. She’s all
I had left.
ZACH
You could have found a murderer.
ALEKSANDER *
I tried, for months. Hardly anyone
in mourning... and any who were
they were...
Aiming the gun at Aleksander, Zach glares daggers at him. *
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
(ashamed)
They were too dangerous.
ZACH
So you killed an innocent mother.
Max coughs up BLOOD. Zach aims his gun at Maria. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
Don’t move.
Zach carefully places Max on the floor, keeps his gun on
Maria. *
MARIA *
Is that really necessary?
78.
INT. DAINS HOUSE/ 126 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 126
After several attempts at KNOCKING. The front door opens
revealing --
MALE POLICE OFFICER
Police! Open up!
A MALE and a FEMALE POLICE OFFICER. Guns ready they eye --
The destroyed coffee table. The smashed TV and glass on the
floor.
FEMALE POLICE OFFICER
What the fuck?
127 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 127
The male police officer notices a blood stain on the floor.
128 EXT. BACK GARDEN - NIGHT 128
The police officers, proceed with caution, guns aimed toward

129 EXT. ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL CAR PARK - NIGHT 129
Heading to her car, Stacey receives a text from the Nokia:
‘DEN. Come to Ivanov’s Antiques.’
Stacey rushes to her car. Gets in. Starts the engine.
130 INT. STACEY’S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT 130
Driving, Stacey attempts to call ‘Zach.’ No answer.
STACEY
Don’t ignore me, Zach. Do not
fucking ignore me.
The beep of the ‘Answer machine response.’
STACEY (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Zach, don’t you fucking dare do
what I think you’re going to do.
She cuts the call, calls ‘MAX EMERGENCY.’
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 79.
The call rings out. Her frustration grows. A beep.
STACEY (CONT’D)
(into phone)
Max, have your daddy call me,
okay!?
In the distance, she sees a long line of traffic.
STACEY (CONT’D)
FUCK.
Stacey quickly dials 9-1-1.
INT. IVANOV’S ANTIQUE STORE/ BACK STORAGE 131 ROOM - NIGHT 131
Tending to Max, Zach doesn’t see Aleksander get up from his *
chair.
Max coughs blood into Zach’s chest. Mouths the word ‘Daddy.’
ZACH
I got you, son. I got you.
A shotgun cocks to Zach’s head.
ALEKSANDER *
Lower the gun.
BAM! In a flash, Zach SHOOTS Aleksander in the leg, buckling *
him. Maria screams. *
Zach gets up, the upper hand, he aims his gun at Aleksander *
on the floor. Aleksander crawls backwards toward Maria, who *
tends to his wound.
ZACH
You killed my wife! My son is dying
because of you!
Zach keeps the gun on Aleksander, who trembles, terrified. *
ZACH (CONT’D)
Tell me how I end it before I make
a choice of my own.
ALEKSANDER *
We didn’t mean to kill anyone I
swear!
Max coughs blood, his skin almost transparent. Eyes bleeding.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 79A.
Keeping the gun on Aleksander, Zach grabs the music box from *
beside him.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 80.
Zach opens the music box and holds it Max’s eyes.
ALEKSANDER (CONT’D) *
What are you doing!?
Zach turns the handle. The haunting melody plays out.
ZACH
Can’t kill what isn’t here.
The lights fizzle. Zach jerks back as --
Max’s entire body arches backward like a dying slug.
Maria gasps in horror. Aleksander crosses himself. A second *
later --
To Zach’s horror --
Max levitates, in the arched position, off the ground...
His mouth flings open, his jaw LOCKS in position.
He makes a deathly croak.
Zach watches in pure terror as -- Max continues to contort in
the air.
The air is being sucked out of Max, who fights for his life.
Max’s body twists and contorts more violently in the air.
Max is clearly fighting as much as he can. But it’s a losing
battle. Rage sprawled across his face, Zach spits the lines: *
ZACH (CONT’D)
Sacrifice! Dance with death, a *
worthy partner! A final bow! A solo
act! I’ll turn the weak insane! A
living Hell remains! Naked eyes
won’t see me save you!
Suddenly, the music box’s handle STOPS along with the melody
before --
THE SAMODIVA is in the corner. Her twisting, gnarled hands
like those of a hellish puppeteer. Telekinetically --
CRUSHING Max in mid air. In agony, Max twists and turns and
contorts as his bones SNAP under his skin.
He screams in pain and gasps for air. Seconds from a heinous,
merciless death.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 81.
ZACH’S POV: The hopeless, sheer horror slips Zach into a slomotion,
nightmare state. He looks at the Samodiva,
engineering Max’s painful death. His only son.
Zach SNAPS out of his trance.
ZACH (CONT’D)
Hey!
The Samodiva snaps her vision to Zach, giving Max a brief
reprieve.
Only for the Samodiva to throw out a palm toward Zach --
HURLING Zach across the room. He lands head first against the
wall. Blood trickles from his temple.
Zach comes to, but through blurred vision, he sees the
Samodiva, about to crush Max to death from across the room.
Zach desperately and agonizingly aches to his feet -- tries
to run toward the Samodiva -- but she again --
Telekinetically BLASTS Zach against the wall.
Aleksander takes Maria's hand, comforts her as they witness *
the horrifying reality.
Zach tries to muster resilience but it’s no use. Through
blurred vision, Zach sees --
Max reach out for him. Near death desperation.
Zach wipes the tears with his hand. Vision still blurred,
Zach sees the lettering on his hand:
It reads not ‘dieocious,’ but with the ‘o’s’ altered to the
male and female symbols -- an anagram remains -- the word
‘suicide.’
An anagram. All of a sudden, Zach knows exactly what he needs
to do.

Stacey rushes from her car, races toward the antique store.
135 INT. IVANOV'S ANTIQUE STORE/ BACK STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 135
From across the room, the Samodiva twists a finger, snapping
Max’s other knee. Max desperately clutches at the air.
Pleading and SCREAMING for his father, who holds the gun to
his head.
Zach transfers Bella’s wedding ring from right to his left
hand. Grips it in a tight fist.

Zach SHOOTS HIMSELF in the head.
Max falls to the floor, still gripping the music box.
MAX
NOOOOOO!!!! DADDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!
Maria SQUEALS as she ducks under the counter. *
The Samodiva bursts into ASHES that DROP --
Into the music box. The music box’s lid drops shut.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 83.
Max is glaring -- traumatized -- at his dead father.
Aleksander struggles to digest what he just witnessed. *
Stacey BURSTS through the store’s entrance door.
Horror and terror across Stacey’s face. Stacey rushes toward
Max, to turn his attention away from the horrible reality.
Hold on the music box for an uncomfortable moment. *

places the music box on a disposable BBQ, douses it in
petrol.
She tosses the match on the box.
Max’s face shimmer behind the rising flames, in which we
notice --
The faint outline of a slim woman in a white dress. She
twists turns, her dress becomes red in the fire -- The

141 INT. DAINS HOUSE/ MAX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 141
‘Moving out’ boxes, scattered around. Labelled ‘Max’s toys.’
‘Max’s clothes.’ ‘Max’s books.’ ‘Max’s video games.’ A walker
by his bed. A night light.
Stacey kisses Max goodnight. His legs and arms in casts, his
neck in a brace. He grips his torch, flicks it on and off. *
MAX
Promise me he didn’t want to die.
STACEY
He did it because he loves you.
MAX
Even more than a cat loves mice
krispies?
Stacey smiles.
STACEY
Yeah.
Then flicks off the light.
STACEY (CONT’D)
Goodnight, prince. New chapter
tomorrow.
MAX
Goodnight.
Stacey smiles, leaves Max alone. She leaves the door ajar,
causing the hallway’s light to cast against the wall.
Max stares into the semi-blackness. Flicks off his torch. He *
closes his eyes, lays in the silence. Broken by a light
tapping on the closet door.
The banging intensifies, growing into a BANGING that causes
Max’s eyes to SNAP open. It continues from the closet. *
Max flicks the torch back on. *
MAX (CONT’D)
Aunt Stacey? Do you hear that?
No response. A now HEAVY BANGING from the closet. Terrified,
Max struggles in his casts but manages to pull the bedsheets
over his head. Max cowers under the sheets.
The GROAN of the opening closet door. Nearing footsteps and
heavy breaths. Closer and closer and closer.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 84A.
Max trembles. Then -- nothing. He conjures the courage to
pull away the bedsheets. Nothing there.
Pink Rev. (08/13/25) 85.
The closet door is closed. But eyes the closet -- desperate
for peace of mind.
He struggles out of bed, grabs his walker and slowly hobbles
toward the closet. He opens the closet.
Nothing. Relieved, he places the torch, still on, into the *
closet. Turns and hobbles back to his bed. Climbs in. *
Satisfied he’s safe, he turns around to see --
BAM! A flash of JAKE’S dead face.
Max blinks and it’s gone. Terrified, he turns onto his back
and glares at the ceiling.
The closet door slowly closes with a soft thud. Max stares at
the thin beams of light protruding through the slits in the
closet door. When --
CLICK. The torchlight dies. Shrouding Max in darkness.
